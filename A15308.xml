         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſaith, to name, yet cunningly nameth, I doubt not, but that hee will not be afraid to anſwere him more fully; neither will all my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> clamours, and threatnings diſcourage him from defending the truth, his Prince, and Countrey, for the loue wherof, &amp; not for any hope of temporall lucre or preferment, or for to ſhew his wit as my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> falſly affirmeth, he will not be aſhamed to be Preſt on to write againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> or any other ſuch like Authour, who liuing in other Countries, and out of danger to looſe any thing, but rather in hope to obtaine preferment by their writings, would preſſe Engliſh Catholikes to defend with danger of looſing all they haue, and of incurring his <hi>Maieſties</hi> high diſpleaſuer that doctrine for the Popes power to depoſe Princes to be of faith, which the <hi>State of France</hi> hath accounted <hi>ſcandalous, ſeditious, damnable,</hi> and <hi>pernicious.</hi> In the meane time let this ſuffice, that he is a childe of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, and as good a Catholike, if not better then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> is, if we will dulie conſider the true nature and definition of a <hi>Catholike,</hi> and that he is no true <hi>Catholike,</hi> who with true <hi>Catholike</hi> and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall faith beleeueth doubtfull, diſputable, and vncertaine opinions, and which conſequently are ſubiect to errour, to which true <hi>Catholike</hi> faith cannot in any wiſe be expoſed.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20729:20"/>
the Catholike Church whom I reuerence and loue as my deare mother (and to whoſe Cenſure I euer haue and do alſo now moſt humbly ſubmit my ſelfe and all my writings) but the priuate opinions of ſome few Catholikes, eſpecially <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> who will needes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force vpon the Chriſtian world, doubtfull, diſputable and vncertaine opinions, for infallible grounds of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall faith, which onely is the fortreſſe of the Catholike Church.

(Curteous Reader) what is the true ſtate of the queſtion betwixt vs concerning the Popes power to depoſe Princes, and what was my chiefe intent in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that diſputation of the Oath. <hi>The maine queſtion therefore betwixt me,</hi> and theſe my <hi>Aduerſaries,</hi> as my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> T.

               <hi>is touching the Popes power to depoſe Princes, which ſpecially is denied in this new oath:</hi> to wit, whether it be a point of faith, and not to be denied by any Catholike without note of hereſie, or errour, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath by <hi>Chriſt</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution power to depriue temporall Princes of their Kingdomes for any crime whatſoeuer.

although in very deede hitherto I haue not ſeene any ſufficient reaſon to condemne the ſayd oath as vnlawfull, and from the doctrine which I taught in my <hi>Apologie</hi> it doth neceſſarily follow, that with a probable and ſafe conſcience it may bee taken by any Catholike, conſidering that the Popes power to depoſe Princes, as my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> heere confeſſeth, is the maine queſtion betwixt him and me, and which is ſpecially denied in this oath, neuertheleſſe I did not intend in that <hi>Disputation</hi> poſitiuely to defend the ſayd oath, but ſincerely to propound vnto his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> who as I am fully perſwaded, was neither truely, nor throughly informed of the reaſons, why Engliſh Catholikes thought the ſayd oath to bee lawfull, all the arguments on both ſides, which might be vrged againſt or for the oath, affirming nothing of my ſelfe, but as repreſenting the perſons of thoſe, who either impugned or approoued the ſayd oath; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requeſting his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> that after he had diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined the reaſons on both ſides, he would bee pleaſed to ſatisfie thoſe difficulties, which wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and to make knowne to vs Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, thoſe many things, which he in his <hi>Breues</hi> had affirmed to be in this oath cleerely repugnant to faith and ſaluation.</p>

ſelfe, but it muſt alſo be able in ſome ſort to counterpoyſe the arguments and proofes of the contrary opinion: for often it falleth out that the reaſons of one part are ſo pregnant, that they ſeeme to conuince, and yet when they are weighed with the reaſons of the other part, they are neither pregnant, nor ſo much as</hi> probable: <hi>for according to the old prouerbe,</hi> one tale is good vntill an other be heard.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſquez</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that if a learned man, who hath throughly ſeene, and examined all the reaſons of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part, ſhall iudge againſt all other writers, who haue gone before him, that his opinion is the more</hi> probable, <hi>he may although it be the leſſe ſecure opinion, embrace it, and in practiſe follow it,</hi> his aſſertion is generall, whether it be concerning any doctrinal point, which is thought to belong to faith, or any text of holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> or any decree or definition of <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> which are in controuerſie among Catholikes.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſquez</hi> doctrine, it is lawfull for other men, who hold the contrarie opinion to be the more <hi>probable,</hi> without any note of <hi>temeritie,</hi> to embrace it, and in practiſe follow it, vnleſſe it be a ſingular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and of one onely Doctour (as this doctrine which denieth the Popes power to depoſe Princes is not ſingular and of one only, but of many, as I will
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20729:34"/>
ſhew beneath:) for then, ſaith Vaſquez, <hi>if it be a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular opinion, and of one onely Doctor, although it may be</hi> probable <hi>to that Doctour</hi> (who is not therefore ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be condemned of <hi>temeritie) yet to him, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not the proper and intrinſecall grounds of that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinion, and of one onely Doctor, and ſeeth it to bee grounded vpon the authoritie of one onely Doctor, hee ought not to account it</hi> probable <hi>to this effect, that he may prudently follow it in practiſe against his owne, and the common opinion of all others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="46">46 But if it be not a ſingular opinion and of one onely Doctour, although the learned men of the contrarie opinion doe vrge for their doctrine ſome law, decree, or definition, which the contrarie part hath ſeene and examined, and hath in ſome ſort an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered therevnto, it is lawfull for any learned man according to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſquez,</hi> to follow in practiſe that other leſſe ſecure and leſſe common opinion, againſt his owne opinion, albeit it be the more ſecure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion. <hi>For when we perceiue,</hi> ſaith Vaſquez, <hi>that the Authors of the contrarie opinion haue ſeene, and conſidered all the grounds and reaſons for our opinion, and haue obſerued that obiection taken from that law or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and haue endeauoured to anſwer them, and that they were not convinced by them, we may iuſtly thinke, that we may prudently and lawfully follow in practiſe the opinion of thoſe other men againſt our owne, neither ought wee to ſuppoſe that our reaſons are euident demonſtrations, and which doe make the contrarie opinion to be voide of all probabilitie.</hi>

            <p n="48">48 By this it is apparant, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> doctrine is to be vnderſtood generally of all caſes, queſtions, and opinions, which are in controuerſie among learned Catholikes, although one or both parts doe pretend their doctrine to be <hi>of faith,</hi> and to be grounded vpon the authoritie of <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> or ſome decree of <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> and that learned Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes ought not, according to <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> to bee eaſily condemned of <hi>temeritie,</hi> and much leſſe of <hi>errour</hi> or <hi>hereſie,</hi> who doe not follow the more common, the more probable, and the more ſecure opinion of other Catholike Doctors, although this common opinion

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſquez</hi> would not condemne the contrarie opinion not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>hereſie,</hi> as my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> would cunningly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Reader, but not ſo much as of <hi>temeritie.</hi> From whence I inferred, that, according to <hi>

            <p n="49">49 As touching the third point it is apparantly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20729:35"/>
vntrue, and very iniurious to Catholikes, and to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion to affirme, <hi>that the</hi> Arrians, <hi>or any other heretikes may well pretend a farre greater probabi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie for the eſtabliſhing of their hereſies, then may I and thoſe other Catholikes, who hold it</hi> probable, <hi>that the Pope hath not power to depoſe Princes.</hi> For (beſides that the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie was expreſſely condemned in the firſt eight <hi>Generall Counſels,</hi> and afterwards in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the <hi>Arrians</hi> haue euer been accounted he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes by ancient Fathers and all other Catholikes, wheras there cannot be alledged ſo much as any ſhew or colour of any one definition of a <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> wherein the doctrine which denyeth the Popes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to depoſe Princes is condemned for <hi>hereticall,</hi> but all the proofes that my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> alledge, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath ſuch a power, are onely ouer-wreſted ſimilitudes, facts, examples, inferences, and ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of their owne, drawne from the authoritie of holy Scriptures, Popes, or Councels) when the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Diuines doe affirme, that the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of learned and skilfull men ſufficeth to make the doctrine or opinion <hi>probable,</hi> which they approue, they vnderſtand of learned and skilfull men appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a doctrine belonging to the art, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, according to that vulgar maxime, <hi>vnicuique in ſua arte perito credendum eſt, we muſt giue credit to euery man skilfull in his art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="50">50 So that in a point of Law, the authoritie of skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lawiers, and not of skilfull Phyſitions, in a point of Phyſike the authoritie of skilfull Phyſitions and not of Lawiers, and in a point of Catholike Religion, the authoritie of learned Catholikes, and who are skilfull in points of Catholike Religion which they profeſſe, and not of heretikes, and who doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Catholike Religion, doth make the opinion, or doctrine which they approue to bee <hi>probable.</hi> And therefore my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> very inſufficiently (not to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20729:36"/>
vſe thoſe fowle words abſurdly &amp; ridiculouſly, which hee ſo often vſeth againſt mee) argueth from the authoritie of learned Catholikes to the authoritie of heretikes, whoſe doctrine according to the definition of <hi>probable,</hi> can neuer make the opinions, which they approue in points of Catholike Religion, which they doe not profeſſe, to be <hi>probable.</hi> Neither by this can any point of Catholike faith, which is knowne to all learned Catholikes to bee a point of Catholike faith, be eaſily called in queſtion, and made onely <hi>probable,</hi> for that no learned Catholike will cal in queſtion any doctrine, which is cleerely knowne to be the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, and as for heretikes their authoritie can neuer make any doctrine belonging any way to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion, which they doe not profeſſe, to be <hi>probable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="51">51 But if there ſhould ariſe any controuerſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong learned Catholikes, whether this or that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be of faith, and in what ſenſe the words of ſuch a text of holy Scripture, or of ſuch a Canon, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Pope or Councell are to be vnderſtood, there is no doubt, but that the authoritie of learned Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes may in thoſe caſes make their opinion <hi>probable</hi> although other Catholikes would be ſo ſtiffe in their owne opinion, as to condemne the contrarie part of <hi>hereſie, errour,</hi> or <hi>temeritie.</hi> A manifeſt example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue in the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> wherein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Iohn Gerſon</hi> and other learned men, who were preſent at that Councell, it was expreſſely defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the Pope is inferiour and ſubiect to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell lawfully aſſembled, and therefore the contrarie to be flat <hi>hereticall,</hi> but ſince that other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, eſpecially Romane Diuines haue called that Decree in queſtion, and haue endeauoured to anſwer therevnto, affirming that it was only meant of Popes in time of Schiſme, or that the aforeſaid Decree was not confirmed by <hi>Pope Martin</hi> in the end of the

Councell, which anſweres neuertheleſſe doe not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Doctors of the contrarie opinion, I doe not thinke, but that my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> will confeſſe, that the opinion of the Romans may bee accounted <hi>probable,</hi> and that the calling of that Decree in queſtion was not the right way to ouerthrow Catholike Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to introduce all <hi>hereſie</hi> and <hi>Atheiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="52">52.

Now that this doctrine for the Popes power to depoſe Princes is not by any <hi>definition</hi> at all of the Church declared to bee true, my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> cannot denie, and that it euer hath been and is impugned by learned Catholikes, and the contrarie hath euer beene, and is by them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, and therefore it is truly <hi>probable,</hi> and not only hath a pretence of <hi>probabilitie</hi> I will ſhew beneath, where I will both relate the Catholike Authours, who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20729:37"/>
deny this authoritie of the Pope to depoſe Princes, which only is ſufficient to make their doctrine <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and alſo I will diſcouer the inſufficiencie of thoſe <hi>Replies,</hi> which my <hi>Aduerſary</hi> hath made againſt my anſweres.

            <p n="53">53.

               </gap>e other are called <hi>extrinſecall grounds,</hi> which doe onely conſiſt in the authority of thoſe learned men, who doe hold that doctrine or opinion, becauſe according to that which hath been ſaid before, that doctrine is trulie <hi>probable,</hi> which is approued by wiſe and skilfull men in the art which they profeſſe; and by theſe onely grounds vnlearned men can be perſwaded, that any doctrine or opinion is truly <hi>probable.</hi>

            <p n="54">54. Now my <hi>Aduerſarie ſeeing,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>that all my pretended probabilitie conſiſteth partly in the authority of thoſe Authours, which I haue brought in my</hi> Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Diſputation, <hi>and in my</hi> Apologie, <hi>and partly in the

            <p n="55">55. Beſides, from my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> own wordes the Reader may eaſily perceiue a great fraude of his. For my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> confeſſeth, that I haue brought <hi>many Authours partly in my Theologicall Diſputation,</hi> and <hi>partly in my Apologie,</hi> which is very true; for in my <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall Diſputation</hi> of ſet purpoſe I choſe out certaine <hi>Authours</hi> named in my <hi>Apologie,</hi> which I thought did ſpeake more plainly, and againſt which no iuſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could be taken; whereunto alſo I added certaine
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20729:38"/>
other <hi>Authours</hi> which in my <hi>Apologie</hi> were not named at all: And yet my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> remitteth his Reader for an anſwere to them all, to D. <hi>Schulckenius,</hi> who hath only anſwered (but how inſufficiently you ſhall ſee beneath) thoſe authorities which I brought in my <hi>Apologie:</hi> for my <hi>Theologicall Disputation</hi> he could not at that time ſee, it being then but in the PRINTERS hands. But the plaine truth is, that vnleſſe my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie</hi> would haue ſhewed apparantly to wrangle and cauill, hee could take no iuſt exception whereby his Reader might be fully ſatisfied, againſt thoſe <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,</hi> which I brought in my <hi>Theologicall Diſputation,</hi> and therfore he thought it his beſt courſe cunningly to ſhift them of, and not to meddle with the anſwering of them at all, leaſt the <hi>Reader</hi> perceiuing ſo many learned Catholikes to ioyne with <hi>Widdrington</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this doctrine for the Popes power to depoſe Princes eſpecially to be a point of faith, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obſerue both the fraudulent proceeding of my <hi>Aduerſarie,</hi> who laboureth to perſwade his Reader, that only <hi>Widdrington</hi> doth impugne this authoritie of the Pope to depoſe Princes, and alſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie doctrine being approued not only by <hi>Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> but alſo by ſo many learned Catholikes is, and ought to be accounted truly <hi>probable,</hi> and therefore may according to <hi>Vaſquez</hi> doctrine without any note of <hi>temeritie</hi> be embraced by any Catholike. But of theſe authorities I will treat more at large beneath. And thus much concerning my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> fourth Admonition, and all the foure points thereof.</p>
            <p n="56">56.

(as I haue ſhewed) but alſo to his</hi> Maieſties <hi>ſeruice, which he pretendeth to further and aduance thereby; for he cannot denie, but that the contrary opinion being</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable <hi>(as he confeſſeth it to be) may bee lawfully imbraced by all men; whereupon it followeth, that any man may not only refuſe the oath lawfully, but alſo hold, that his</hi> Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie <hi>may be depoſed by his owne ſubiects vpon a ſentence of Excommunication and Depoſition, and that conſequently they may lawfully take armes againſt his</hi> Maieſty <hi>in that caſe; and this being ſo, what ſecurity hath his</hi> Maieſty, <hi>or aduancement of his ſeruice by this mans doctrine?

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:20729:40"/>63 My <hi>first</hi> reaſon was, for that it is againſt the truth and puritie of the Catholike Church, <hi>Shee</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>pillar and ground of truth,</hi> that doubtfull opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and which among Catholikes are onely in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, and by the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> haue been condemned as <hi>ſcandalous, ſeditious, damnable,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,</hi> ſhould be enforced vpon Engliſh Catholikes, as an vndoubted doctrine of the Catholike faith, to the vtter ouerthrow of themſelues, and their whole poſteritie, by men who are in no danger to looſe, but rather to gaine temporall aduancement by their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. My <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon was to aſſure his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> that all Engliſh Catholikes may, if they will, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the grounds of Catholike Religion be true and conſtant Subiects to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any ſentence of Excommunication or depriuation denounced, or to be denounced againſt his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> whereby his Subiects ſhould be abſolued from their Allegiance, or commanded not to obey him in temporall cauſes, they <hi>may</hi> with a ſafe conſcience, &amp; alſo in practiſe (marke well what I ſay) they are <hi>bound</hi> to adhere to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> to obey him in temporall cauſes, as ſtill remayning their true and lawfull Soueraigne, and to reſiſt any ſuch ſentence of Excommunication or depriuation.</p>
            <p n="64">64 The reaſon wherefore I affirmed, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes <hi>may</hi> with a ſafe conſcience adhere to his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,</hi> and reſiſt the <hi>Popes</hi> ſentence of depriuation, was, for that it is a <hi>probable</hi> opinion, and which with a ſafe conſcience, and without danger of <hi>hereſie, error,</hi> or <hi>temeritie</hi> may be embraced by Catholikes, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no authoritie to depoſe Princes, nor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict any temporall puniſhments by way of coercion, but that the laſt puniſhment, to which the coerciue power of the Church doth extend, are onely Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall and ſpirituall Cenſures. Wherefore that which my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that I confeſſe, it to be

parts of the Oath, which belong to ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are not ſubiect to the Popes power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpencing, as I ſhewed at large in my <hi>Theologicall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation</hi>

Now whether this my doctrine doth not onely giue no ſecuritie to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> but is alſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and pernicious to his <hi>Maieſties</hi> ſafetie (as this my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> to procure his <hi>Maieſties</hi> diſpleaſure againſt me falſely and vnlearnedly affirmeth) if the Pope ſhould denounce any ſentence of depriuation againſt him, I leaue to the iudgement of any ſenſible man.

of that howſe or land, before the Iudge hath decided the controuerſie.</p>
            <p n="78">78 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> conſider the reaſon, why this my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> T.

His reaſon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, for that he ſaw right well, what great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage I had againſt him, and what little aduantage hee had againſt me in arguing or rather anſwering in this manner; and therefore he calleth it in heate of his zeale, as you haue heard, <hi>The most deuiliſh deuice that any man could invent.</hi> And truly if I ſhould at this firſt beginning haue treated of this controuerſie in any other manner, then by handling it <hi>probably</hi> in that ſenſe as I haue declared, I might worthily haue been taxed of great imprudencie in giuing my <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> more aduantage againſt me then was needfull. For this is the ſtate of the queſtion, <hi>whether it can bee clearely convinced by the authoritie of holy Scriptures, ancient Fathers, Generall Councells, or by neceſſarie infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from any of them,</hi> as my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> pretend to convince, <hi>that it is an vndoubted doctrine of faith, and the contrarie not to be maintained by any Catholike, that the Pope hath power to depoſe Princes, and conſequently that the Oath can not lawfully be taken.</hi> This is the queſtion.</p>
            <p n="79">79 Marke now the aduantage I haue. For <hi>firſt</hi> I am not to proue, but only to anſwer, to defend, not to oppoſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is ſufficient for me, that my

Anſwers be onely probable, but their Replyes muſt not be onely probable, but alſo convincing, and which can not with any probabilitie be anſwered. So that if I ſhould goe about at the firſt to proue my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be moſt true, which my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> contend not to be queſtionable, I ſhould, as it is euident, greatly diſaduantage my ſelfe. For in ſuch contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies as are ſo violently maintained by the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that hee will not grant the contrarie part to be queſtionable, it is neceſſarie to proceed by degrees; firſt, to make the thing queſtionable and diſputable, which the aduerſe part will not haue to be called in queſtion; and after this is once agreed vpon, then to examine whether opinion be the trueſt. For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance it may fall out, that as the opinion for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate conception of the <hi>Bleſſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin,</hi> before <hi>Scotus</hi> did oppoſe himſelfe herein againſt <hi>S.

For although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe there be a controuerſie about the manner, how the</hi> Pope <hi>can do it, yet there is no queſtion whether he hath power to doe it. And what need is there to aske aduiſe of</hi> Trithemius, <hi>who oftentimes hath erred in the hiſtorie, which he profeſſeth, as</hi> Antonius Poſſeuine <hi>hath noted in his</hi> Apparatus, <hi>ſeeing that we haue the common opinion of Doctours, and decrees of</hi> Councells, <hi>which doe make the matter cleare.

letteth not, but that <hi>Albericus</hi> is of opinion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power to depoſe Princes, this alſo is euen as true, as that which D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> ſaid before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the errours, which he ſaid <hi>Poſſeuine</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in <hi>Trithemius</hi> his hiſtorie.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But that this is no conuincing proofe, I ſhewed clearely in my <hi>Apologie</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Num <hi>404.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note>. For the Romane Empire was not inſtituted by the authoritie of the Romane Church, ſeeing that he was inſtituted before there was any Romane Church at all, and continued for a long time together the <hi>Soueraigne Lord</hi> in temporalls of the Romane Church. Neither was the Romane Empire tranſlated from the Grecians to the Germans or French men by the grant of the Romane Church, if by the <hi>Romane Church</hi> be meant onely the <hi>Cleargie of Rome,</hi> but it was tranſlated by the grant, ſuffrages, and authoritie alſo of the <hi>Laitie,</hi> who in the weſt parts were ſubiect to the Romane Empire. True alſo it is, that all Catholike Princes ought to be Patrons, defenders, and protectours of the Romane Church (but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperour more ſpecially) they being children
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20729:58"/>
and members of the Catholike Romane Church, and euery member is bound to defend eath other, but eſpecially to defend the head. And therefore I will eaſily grant, that the Pope may exact, if need require, not only of the Romane Emperour, but alſo of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholike Princes an oath of ſpirituall allegiance, but that Catholike Princes are ſubiect to the Pope in temporalls, and that the Pope may exact of them an oath of temporall allegiance, this is that I vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, neither will Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or any other be able by any ſufficient argument to conuince the contrary; wherefore it cannot with any ſhew of probabilitie be denied, but that we haue the teſtimonie of <hi>Albericus,</hi> a man excellently learned, and a Claſſicall Doctour, that the Pope hath no authoritie to depoſe Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes, and to diſpoſe of their temporall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>

affirmeth<note n="k" place="margin">De poteſt. Regia &amp; Pap. cap: <hi>6. 7.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>that the Pope is not a Lord, to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of Church liuings doth belong, but onely a diſpencer of them, but of the goods of Laymen he is not ſo much as a diſpencer; vnleſſe perchance in extreame neceſſitie of the Church, in which neceſſitie alſo he is not a diſpencer, but a declarer of the law. And becauſe in extreame neceſſitie of faith and manners, all the goods of the faithfull, yea and Chalices of Churches are to be communicated, the Pope, who is ſupreme not onely of the Cleargie, but of all the faithfull, as they are faithfull, hath authoritie, as he is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall informer of faith and manners, in caſe of extreame neceſſitie of faith and manners to diſpence in this caſe the goods of the faithfull, &amp; to ordaine them to be expoſed, as it is expedient for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon neceſſitie of faith, which other wiſe would be ouerthrown by the invaſion of Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or other ſuch like accident. And this ordination of the Pope is only a declaration of the law, to which he may by Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures compell the faithfull.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4 In the very like manner <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> diſcourſeth of the diſpoſing of Kingdomes, and of depoſing temporall Princes, as I before related out of him.

For <hi>firſt</hi> he affirmeth, <hi>that the Pope hath no authoritie to depoſe a King iuridically,</hi> or, which is all one, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue him by a iuridicall ſentence of his right to reigne; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that the people, or temporall common-wealth may, and in ſome exorbitant caſes are bound to depoſe their Prince; and ſo the Pope not by a iuridicall ſentence of depriuation, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what the people are by the law of God bound to doe, and by Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures compelling them therevnto, may according to <hi>Pariſienſis,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the depoſing of a Prince by meanes of the people, which if the people, notwithſtanding the <hi>Popes</hi> Cenſures neglect to doe, the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power to depoſe him, for that <hi>Eccleſiasticall Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are,</hi> according to him, <hi>the last puniſhment, which the Eccleſiasticall power can inflict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Wherefore two things are affirmed by <hi>Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis,</hi> the one, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no authoritie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue Princes immediately by his ſentence of their Princely power, and this is that only, which is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betwixt mee and <hi>Card: Bellarmine:</hi> the other, that the people, or temporall common-wealth haue that authoritie in ſome exorbitant caſes: and this is only a philoſophicall queſtion, and wherewith I would neuer intermeddle, as being impertinent to the queſtion concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue him.

                     </note> I demand, whether thoſe Prieſts doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the ſentence of the Pope depoſing a baptized Queene for crimes may be iuſt, or they beleeue that it is alwaies vniuſt. The firſt they will not in my opinion affirme, for otherwiſe they ſhould promiſe a moſt wicked thing, to wit, not to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20729:67"/>
obey a iuſt ſentence, which implieth in it a iuſt command. For if the ſentence bee iuſt, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand alſo, which enioyneth ſubiects to obſerue it, muſt alſo be iuſt, ſeeing that otherwiſe it cannot be put in execution. Alſo if the ſentence of depoſition denounced againſt a Queene may bee iuſt, it will alſo be effectuall, therefore it hath the effect of that puniſhment which it impoſeth. Wherefore ſeeing that the puniſhment impoſed by the ſentence of depoſition from her Kingdome, is to depriue her actually, or effectually of her dominion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie to her Kingdome, a iuſt ſentence doth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually depriue her of her Kingdome, therefore it is againſt iuſtice and obedience due vnto the Pope to reſiſt that ſentence, and to defend the Queenes perſon againſt the execution of that ſentence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee that beleeueth the firſt, and neuertheleſſe promiſeth this ſecond, doth promiſe a thing cleerly vniuſt and wicked.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">
                  <q>9 And beſides it implieth a contradiction to be willing to yeeld obedience and allegeance, as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy ſelfe bound ſo to doe, to one whom thou knoweſt to be by a iuſt declaration and ſentence ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually depoſed from her Kingdome. As if the Pope himſelfe ſhould exact of Chriſtians a promiſe, that notwithſtanding any ſentence or declaration of depoſing him for any crime euen for hereſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by whatſoeuer generall Councell, they will defend him in his See, and will yeelde him the ſame obedience and allegeance, their promiſe were wicked, for that it were a wicked thing, and againſt the Church &amp; Faith. Such therfore is the promiſe of thoſe Prieſts, if the aforeſaid ſentence againſt the Queene bee ſuppoſed to bee iuſt. This therefore thoſe Prieſts without doubt will not admit, neither alſo are they, as I thinke, ſo inconſiderate of their affaires, that if they grant the Popes ſentence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20729:68"/>
againſt a <hi>Queene</hi> may be iuſt, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will deny that againſt the <hi>Queene</hi> of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland it may haue the ſame iuſtice. For what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter immunitie or innocencie can they alledge in the <hi>Queene</hi> of England, then in other Princes, who haue beene rebells to the Romane Church, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakers and impugners of the faith. Or although they do not acknowledge, that the <hi>Queene</hi> for that time had not committed any thing worthy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, how doe they know, that for the time to come ſhe cannot? and yet their promiſe is abſolute, <hi>notwithſtanding any authoritie, or any ſentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication denounced or to be denounced againſt the</hi> Queene, <hi>or euery one borne within her</hi> Maieſties <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore there is no doubt, but that the ground of this promiſe and profeſſion is, that ſuch a ſentence cannot bee iuſt. Wherefore from hence we euidently conclude, that thoſe Prieſts by the aforeſaid words do profeſſe, that the ſentence of depoſition againſt the <hi>Queene</hi> can neither be valid nor iuſt. For in very deede this they doe profeſſe, when they promiſe not to obey, nor to obſerue ſuch a ſentence.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">
                  <q>10. Whereupon we do moreouer conclude, that thoſe Prieſts doe profeſſe, that the Pope hath not power to denounce ſuch a ſentence, ſeeing that for no other cauſe they doe beleiue the ſentence to be vniuſt, but for that it is giuen without power and Iuriſdiction in the <hi>Pope</hi> to depoſe a <hi>Queene.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can thoſe Prieſts alledge in ſuch a ſentence any other cauſe of iniuſtice, which is perpetuall, and may be a ground of this part of their profeſſion. for their profeſſion doth not ſpeake of a ſentence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie denounced, but abſolutely of a ſentence <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced</hi> or to be <hi>denounced</hi> againſt the <hi>Queene:</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth comprehend euery ſentence, whether it bee giuen the partie being heard, or not heard,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20729:68"/>
whether for diſagreement in religion, or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crime, or cauſe whatſoeuer. Wherefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice which thoſe Prieſts do ſuppoſe to bee in that ſentence and wherupon they ground their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no other, but for that they beleeue, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceede from a lawfull power and Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore I conclude that they profeſſe, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not power and Iuriſdiction to giue a ſentence of depoſition againſt the <hi>Queene</hi> for any cauſe.</q> Thus argueth Father <hi>Suarez.</hi> So that it is euident, that thoſe <hi>thirteene reuerend Prieſts</hi> muſt of neceſſitie ſuppoſe, if they will haue their proteſtation and promiſe to be iuſt and lawfull, that the Pope hath no power to depriued Princes of their Regall right and authoritie.</p>

who, at leaſt wiſe as he is God, is the inviſible head of both powers (I ſay at leaſt wiſe as he is God, for that it is a controuerſie betwixt the Diuines and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts, whether Chriſt as man be only a ſpirituall, or alſo a temporall King) but as they haue relation to their viſible heads here on earth, doe make one totall and compleat bodie, or common-wealth, conſiſting of temporall and ſpirituall power, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is the ſupreme viſible head, and Chriſtian Kings are not ſupreme, but depending on him not onely in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualls, but alſo in temporalls; or whether the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall power among Chriſtians doe truly, properly, and formally make two entire and complete bodies, Kingdoms, or Common-wealths, to wit, the earthly kingdoms of this Chriſtian world, conſiſting only of temporall power, whereof tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes are the ſupreme viſible heads, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in temporalls ſubiect to no other viſible head here on earth, and the ſpirituall kingdom and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body of Chriſt, conſiſting onely of ſpirituall power, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> onely is the ſupreme viſible head, Prince, and Paſtour, and conſequently in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualls ſubiect to no other viſible head or Superiour on earth. This is the true ſtate of the queſtion.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Concerning which queſtion there is a great controuerſie betwixt the Canoniſts, and Diuines. For the Canoniſts ſuppoſing Chriſt our Sauiour to bee, not onely a ſpirituall, but alſo a temporall King, and to haue directly and properly both temporall and ſpirituall power, ouer the whole world, and that hee gaue this power to his Generall Vicar here on earth <hi>S.

viſible head, to whom all Princes, eſpecially who are Chriſtians, are ſubiect not only in ſpiritualls, but alſo in temporalls. But contrariwiſe the Diuines, who doe hold, that Chriſt as man, was not a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but only a ſpirituall King, and although hee had directly both temporall and ſpirituall power, yet that he gaue to <hi>S.

               <p n="7">7 Now what is the opinion of Card: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> touching this point, for that he ſpeaketh ſo contrarie to his owne principles, truly I can not tell.

                  <hi>Apologie,</hi> that the meaning of <hi>S.

               <p n="4">4. And whereas <hi>Card.

                  </note> pretended to confute concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> ſpirituall and temporall Monarchie ouer the whole Chriſtian world. For if the Church of Chriſt be one totall body or common-wealth compounded of Eccleſiaſtical and ciuill pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as a man is compounded of ſoule and body (for this is that ſimilitude which ſo much pleaſeth Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and is therefore ſo often inculcated by him) it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> in whom, according to his other grounds, all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Church doth reſide, muſt haue truly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and formally both temporall and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power, as a man who is compounded of ſoule and bodie, hath truely, properly and formally in him both the ſoule and bodie, and all the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20729:87"/>
of them both: And what elſe is this, I pray you, then to maintaine with the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> that the Pope as Pope is both a temporall and ſpirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and that hee hath truely, properly and formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both ciuill and ſpirituall authority: And yet Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in other places doth expreſſely affirme, that the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope</hi> hath onely ſpirituall and not temporall power.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>The Diuines,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="h" place="margin">In his book againſt D. <hi>Barclay</hi> ca. 12. pag. 137.</note> 
                  <hi>doe giue to the Pope tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall power onely in the Dominions of the Church, which power in the patrimonie of S.</hi> Peter <hi>Pope</hi> Innocent <hi>in cap. per venerabilem doth call a full power; ouer other Chriſtian Prouinces they doe giue to the Pope onely a ſpirituall power, which of it ſelfe and properly doth regard ſpirituall things, but temporall things it doth regard as they are ſubordained to ſpirituall. And therefore when we ſpeake properly, we ſay that the Pope hath power in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, but not that he hath temporall power, as he is Pope.</hi> Now how theſe two can ſtand together, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall power among Chriſtians doe make one entire and totall body, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is the ſupreme viſible head, as the body and ſoule doe make one man, and yet that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> ſhall haue no temporall power, which in it ſelfe is tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but onely ſpirituall, athough in ſome caſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to temporall things, ſeeing that theſe two powers doe truely compoſe the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently both of them are truly and really in the Church which they compound, and ſo likewiſe in the <hi>Pope,</hi> in whom all the power of the Church doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, I remit to the iudgement of any ſenſible man.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beſides what a more flat contradiction can there be, then this, to ſay, <hi>that the ciuill and ſpirituall power among Chriſtians doe compound indeede two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but one entire and totall common-wealth, which is the Church of Chriſt, or Chriſtian common-wealth,</hi> as hee heere affirmeth,<note n="i" place="margin">In his <hi>Schulc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenius</hi> cap. 5. pag. 195.</note> and withall, <hi>that the Church of Chriſt

or the Chriſtian common-wealth is compounded onely of ſpirituall authoritie,</hi> as a little beneath hee affirmeth in theſe words:<note n="d" place="margin">In his <hi>Schulckenius</hi> cap 5. p. 203.</note> 
                  <hi>That which my Aduerſarie</hi> Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>ſaith, that the myſticall bodie, Church, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian common-wealth is compounded of ſpirituall authority alone, is true in this ſenſe, that to compound the Chriſtian common-wealth there is not neceſſary a power, which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally ciuill, but yet there is neceſſarie a power, which is ſo formally ſpirituall, that it is alſo vertually ciuill</hi> &amp;c. For how can the Church of Chriſt be compounded of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and ſpirituall power, which are formally two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct powers, and yet the Church not haue power which is formally ciuill, but onely ſpirituall? Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I doe not intend to denie, that the ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall power among Chriſtians may in this ſenſe be called vertually ciuill or temporall, becauſe it may for the ſpirituall good command, and compell <hi>ſpiritually</hi> temporall Princes to vſe their temporall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, for this were onely to contend about words, but that the Church of Chriſt, whereof the Pope is head, is truely, properly and formally compounded of ciuil and ſpiritualll power, this I ſay is both vntrue, and alſo flat contrarie to Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own grounds; but whether the ſpiritual power of the church may be called vertually ciuill or temporal, for that it may alſo conſtraine and puniſh temporall Princes <hi>temporally,</hi> or vſe temporall and ciuill authoritie, in caſe the temporall Prince for the ſpirituall good will not vſe it, this is the maine queſtion betwixt mee and Card. <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. To conclude therefore, this anſwere I doe freely grant: that <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Biſhops, Clearks</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks,</hi> as by baptiſme they are regenerate in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> doe truely, properly, and formally, make one entire and totall body, which is the ſpirituall kingdome, and Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is the ſupreme vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible head: but I vtterly deny, that this ſpirituall
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20729:88"/>
kingdome, or Church of Chriſt is compounded of ſpirituall and temporall, but onely of ſpirituall, or Eccleſiaſticall power: or that <hi>Clearks</hi> and <hi>Laicks,</hi> as they are citizens, or by their naturall birth are ſubiect in temporall affaires to temporall Princes doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but onely the earthly kingdomes of the Chriſtian world, which are onely compounded of ciuill and temporall authority. In which Chriſtian world, or Chriſtian common-wealth, (taking them for an <hi>aggregatum per accidens,</hi> including both the ſpirituall kingdome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is head, and alſo earthly kingdomes, whereof Chriſtian Princes are the onely viſible heads, for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſeldome times taken in this ſenſe) there is but one totall or intire Catholike Church: yet there be many intire temporall kingdomes or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, as of Engliſh, French, Spaniſh, which haue their ſeuerall Princes, Lawes, and gouernments, and haue no other communion then in friendſhip and amitie: Yea, &amp; the Catholike Church is one totall body, or common-wealth in Chriſtian and Infidell kingdomes. And alſo in one particular Chriſtian kingdome there be two diſtinct totall bodies, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, to wit, the temporall, conſiſting of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill power, and the Eccleſiaſticall, conſiſting of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: wherein as there bee two diſtinct communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the one ſpirituall in things belonging to grace, and the other temporall in things belonging to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So alſo their be two excommunications, the one in ſpirituals; wherein thoſe that be excommunicated by the Church, doe not participate, and the other in temporalls; whereof thoſe, who be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, or made out-lawes by temporall Princes, are not partakers; in ſo much that they, who are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of one of theſe communions, are not thereby depriued of the other, for an out-law may be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, and be partaker of ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20729:88"/>
and he, who by Excommunication is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of Eccleſiaſticall communion, may bee a member of the ciuill common-wealth, as Heathens and Publicans were, and not therefore to be excluded from ciuill ſocietie and conuerſation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wherefore although the temporall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power among Chriſtians, as they are referred to the viſible heads thereof, doe truely, properly, and formally make diuerſe totall bodies, or common-wealths, which neuertheleſſe ought both to conſpire in league &amp; friendſhip, to bring both Princes and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to life euerlaſting: yet they are not like to two confederate Cities or Kingdomes, which are onely vnited in league and amity, and haue no ciuill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with the other, neither is the ſame man a citizen of both Cities, or a ſubiect of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; but the temporall and ſpirituall power are ſo vnited among Chriſtians, that the ſame man, who by ciuill conuerſation, or naturall birth is a citizen, part, and member of the temporall City, Kingdome, or Common-wealth, and conſequently ſubiect to her Lawes, is alſo by baptiſme or ſpirituall regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made a citizen, part, or member of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Citie, Kingdome, or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, which is the Church of Chriſt, and conſequently is alſo ſubiect to her Lawes. So that although the vnion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of earthly Kingdomes, and the ſpirituall kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> bee greater among Chriſtians, then of two confederate Cities or temporall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, yet this vnion and communion being onely material, accidentall, and in ſubiect (as Muſicke and Phyſicke are vnited in one man, by reaſon whereof the ſame man is both a Muſician and a Phyſician, and conſequently ſubiect to the precepts and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of either art) is not ſufficient to cauſe them to make truely properly, and formally one totall body, kingdome, or common-wealth, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:20729:89"/>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>FIrſt</hi> therefore, that you may perceiue the true ſtate of the queſtion, and wherein I doe agree with <hi>Card: Bellarmine,</hi> and wherein we differ, I doe agree with him in this, that Chriſtian Princes, in whom the ſupreme temporall power doth reſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſheepe of Chriſt, no leſſe then inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are ſubiect to the ſupreme viſible Paſtour of the Church of Chriſt: but the queſtion is, in what things, and alſo in what manner they are ſubiect. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we alſo agree in this, that Chriſtian Princes are in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, or which doe belong to Chriſtian faith and Religion, ſubiect not onely to the directiue, or commanding power, but alſo in ſpirituall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the coerciue or puniſhing power of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Paſtors, in ſuch ſort, that Chriſtian Princes are not onely bound to obey the command of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Paſtors, in things which doe concerne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith and religion, but alſo, if they be diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they may with ſpirituall puniſhments he puniſhed and compelled therevnto. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we doe alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, that Chriſtian Princes are bound to obey the commanding power of ſpirituall Paſtours, not only in thoſe things, which of their owne nature are
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20729:91"/>
Eccleſiaſticall or ſpirituall, but alſo in things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, when <hi>by accident</hi> they become ſpirituall; in ſo much that a ſpirituall Paſtor hath authoritie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a temporall Prince to vſe or not vſe his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power, when it is neceſſarie or hurtfull to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith and religion, but this is nothing elſe, then that temporall Princes in things ſpirituall (for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of <hi>their owne nature,</hi> or onely by <hi>accident</hi> ſpirituall, it little importeth) are ſubiect to the commanding power of ſpirituall Paſtors, as likewiſe all temporall cauſes and crimes, whether of <hi>their owne nature,</hi> or onely by <hi>accident</hi> they become temporall, are ſubiect to the commanding and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciue power of temporall Princes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But the controuerſie betwixt me and Card: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is concerning two things; the firſt is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the commanding power, to wit, whether temporall Princes are ſubiect to the commanding power of ſpirituall Paſtors, not onely in things ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and in temporall, when they become ſpirituall, but alſo in meere temporall things; for this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly temporall power (taking temporall power in <hi>abſtracto</hi>) to be ſubiect to the ſpirituall For as a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> can not truly be ſaid to be ſubiect, as he is a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and in all things belonging to Muſicke, to a Phyſition as he is a Phyſition, for that Muſicke is not <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature referred to Phyſicke, and if Muſicke were <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubiect to Phyſicke, a Muſician, as he is a Muſician, and in all things belonging to Muſicke, ſhould be ſubiect to a Phyſician, as he is a Phyſician: for which cauſe a Shipwright, as he is a Shipwright, hath intrinſecall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a Nauigator, for that the Art of making ſhips is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ordayned for nauigation; So alſo if the temporall power among Chriſtians be <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubiect to the ſpirituall power, it muſt follow, that temporall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20729:92"/>
Princes, who are Chriſtians, are, as they are temporall Princes, and in all things belonging to temporall power, ſubiect to ſpirituall Paſtours, as they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Paſtours: And if temporall Princes, who be Chriſtians, are not ſubiect, as they are temporall Princes, to ſpirituall Paſtors, as they are ſpirituall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, the temporall power among Chriſtians is not <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubiect to the ſpirituall power.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing, which is in controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me, and <hi>Card.

And this is the maine point, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſcope, at which both the Canoniſts, who hold that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath directly power in temporals <hi>in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> although <hi>the vſe</hi> they haue committed to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Princes,</hi> and alſo the Diuines, who hold that hee hath onely indirectly, that is, in order to ſpirituall good, power in temporalls, doe chiefly aime. Now concerning theſe two points, there be three different opinions of Catholikes.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The <hi>firſt</hi> opinion is of the Canoniſts, who holding, that the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is the ſupreme viſible head, doth conſiſt both of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall power, doe conſequently hold, that all Chriſtian Princes, not only as they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but alſo as they are temporall Princes, are in all temporall cauſes ſubiect to the <hi>commanding</hi> power, and in all temporall puniſhments ſubiect alſo to the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20729:92"/>
                  <hi>coerciue</hi> power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom they make the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, both temporall and ſpirituall Monarch of the world, and to haue directly both temporall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power, although the vſe, exerciſe, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his temporall power, he hath out of the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Church, committed to Secular Princes, as to his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice-Royes, Vicegerents,</hi> or <hi>Deputies:</hi> and this doctrine ſome Lawyers held to be ſo certaine, that they were not afraid to condemne the contrarie as <hi>hereticall,</hi> for which they are worthily taxed by <hi>Coverruvias</hi>

                  </note>, I will not at this time intermeddle.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The <hi>ſecond</hi> opinion is of many Schoole-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines eſpecially of theſe later times, who although they ſeeme greatly to miſlike the Canoniſts opinion, in that the Canoniſts hold the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> to haue directly, not only ſpirituall, but alſo temporall power, and to be both a temporall Monarch, and alſo a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Prince and Paſtour of the whole Chriſtian world, yet in effect they doe giue as full and ample authoritie to the <hi>Pope</hi> ouer Chriſtian Princes, as the Canoniſts do; for whatſoeuer the Canoniſts affirme, that the <hi>Pope</hi> can directly effect by his temporall power, the ſame doe the Diuines affirme, that he can effect indirectly, and in order to ſpirituall good by his ſpirituall power: And therefore, although they will not grant, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath <hi>formally</hi> temporall power, but only ſpirituall, yet they grant, that this ſpirituall power of the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>virtually,</hi> and in effect temporall; and that therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> by his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power can in order to ſpirituall good depriue temporall Princes of their kingdomes, diſpoſe of all their temporalls, puniſh them with all kinde of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments, and finally whatſoeuer tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes can by their temporall power doe for the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20729:93"/>
temporall good, they affirme that the <hi>Pope</hi> by his ſpirituall power can doe for the ſpirituall good. Yea ſome of them doe ſo extend this ſpirituall good and ſpirituall harme, taking ſpirituall harme, not only for ſpirituall crimes, as <hi>hereſie, Apoſtacie,</hi> and ſuch like, but alſo for all temporall crimes, as are <hi>drunkenneſſe, fornication,</hi> and the like, that they giue a more ample power to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to depriue Princes of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, then by temporall lawes is vſually granted to temporall Princes to depriue their ſubiects of their lands, who for whoredome, drunkenneſſe, and many other temporall crimes, can not vſually by the lawes of any Chriſtian kingdome bee depriued of their lands and poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>third</hi> opinion is of many other learned Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes both Diuines and Lawyers whom I cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note n="f" place="margin">Part. <hi>1.</hi> per totum.</note> who although they agree with the ſecond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to command temporall Princes in ſpirituals, but not in meere tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, and to puniſh them with ſpirituall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they refuſe to obey his iuſt command, yet that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath any <hi>coerciue</hi> power (call it ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall or temporall, for in effect it is truely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) to inflict temporall puniſhments, to diſpoſe of temporals for the ſpirituall good, or to depriue tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes of their temporall dominions, they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denie, affirming, that onely Excommunication, or ſome ſuch like ſpirituall puniſhment, is the laſt, to which the <hi>Popes coerciue</hi> power can extend: And this their doctrine, which Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and ſome few others of his <hi>Society,</hi> haue preſumed to condeme as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>improbable,</hi> yea and wholly repugnant to <hi>Catholike faith,</hi> I haue taken vpon me to maintaine, as neither repugnant to Catholike faith or religion, nor preiudiciall to eternall ſaluation, and that therefore it may be defended by any Catholike without any note of <hi>hereſie, errour</hi> or <hi>temerity.</hi>

               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:20729:93"/>7. Theſe bee the different opinions of Catholikes concerning the ſubiection of the temporall power to the ſpirituall, wherby you ſee, that althogh all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes doe grant, that temporall Princes, who are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called temporall powers, are ſubiect to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Paſtour in things ſpirituall, and in temporall when they become ſpirituall, yet all doe not grant, that the temporall power it ſelfe, euen among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubiect to the ſpirituall, nor that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> hath any <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciue</hi> power to conſtraine and puniſh with temporall puniſhments, but onely with ſpirituall; Neither doth it follow, that becauſe Chriſtian Princes are ſubiect to the <hi>Pope,</hi> therefore they are ſubiect in all things, and in all manner of ſubiection, but onely in that ſort, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath giuen him power both to command &amp; puniſh: As children are ſubiect to their Parents, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to their Maſters, wiues to their husbands, yet they are not bound to obey them, but in thoſe things, wherein they haue power to command, nor to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by them, but in that ſort, as the temporall common-wealth, whereof they are members, hath expreſſely or couertly giuen them leaue to puniſh; and the reaſon is, for that they are not <hi>Superiours</hi> in an abſolute and indefinite, but onely in a limited and determinate manner.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now what opinion Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, whether of the Diuines, or of the Canoniſts, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I cannot as yet well vnderſtand. For although he ſeeme to diſallow the Canoniſts doctrine, which at large he confuteth in his controuerſies, yet to prooue the Popes power to depoſe Princes, and to diſpoſe of temporals in order to ſpirituall good, hee laieth ſuch grounds, concerning the vnion and ſubordination of the temporall and ſpirituall power among Chriſtians, which doe cleerely confirme the Canoniſts doctrine. For concerning the vnion of theſe two powers, hee
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20729:94"/>
affirmeth, as you haue ſeene, that the temporall and ſpirituall power, the kingdome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of this world, when they are Chriſtian, doe make one totall body, which is the Chriſtian common-wealth and Church of Chriſt, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is head; from whence it neceſſarily followeth, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> in whom all the power of the Church doth reſide, muſt haue truely, properly and formally both ciuill and ſpirituall power, which is the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts opinion, and not onely ſpirituall power, which is not <hi>formally,</hi> but onely <hi>vertually</hi> ciuill, which the Diuines, and alſo Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in places doe af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firme. And now concerning the ſubiection and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of theſe two powers, he affirmeth, that the temporall power among Chriſtians, not onely as it is Chriſtian, but alſo as it is temporall, is ſubiect to the Eccleſiaſticall, as it is Eccleſiaſticall, or which is all one, that the temporall power it ſelfe among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubiect to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: from whence it cleerely followeth as before I ſhewed by the examples of Muſike and Phyſike, Chriſtian Princes not onely in ſpirituals and in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, when they become ſpirituals, which is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſpirituall good, but alſo in meere temporall cauſes, are ſubiect to ſpirituall Paſtours, which is the Canoniſts opinion, and which Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places doth diſprooue.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But how vnſoundly Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and not conformably to his owne grounds laboreth to proue, that the temporall power it ſelfe among Chriſtians, as it is temporall, is ſubiect to the ſpirituall, as it is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, you ſhall anone perceiue. For ſix principall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I doe finde in Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by which he endeauoureth to conuince, that the temporal power it ſelfe among Chriſtians, as it is temporall, is ſubiect and ſubordained to the ſpirituall, as it is ſpirituall, or, which I take for all one, that the temporall power

                  <p>Wherein is examined Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> firſt argument taken from the ends of the temporall and ſpirituall power.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe <hi>firſt</hi> argument, which <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Rom Pont. c. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> to <hi>demonſtrate, that the temporall power among Chriſtians, not only as it is Chriſtian, but alſo as it is ciuill,</hi> or <hi>temporall, is ſubiect to the Eccleſiaſticall, as it is Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> is taken from the ends of both the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>For a temporall end,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is ſubordained to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall end, as it is manifeſt, becauſe temporall felicitie is not abſolutely the laſt end, and therefore it ought to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to eternall felicitie: but it is apparant out of Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> 1 Ethic. cap. 1. <hi>that faculties, or powers are ſo ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, as their ends are ſubordained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To this argument I anſwered in my <hi>Apologie</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Num. <hi>162.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note>, <q>that not euery temporall end is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ordained, or ſubordained to a ſpirituall end
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20729:95"/>
(ſpeaking of create ends, and not of God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who is the beginning and end of all things) but it is only by <hi>accident,</hi> or accidentally by man, who worketh for an end, ordained to a ſpirituall end. And therefore although temporall good, or felicity be not abſolutely the laſt end of man, yet it is the laſt end of the temporall power it ſelfe, which is in man. For euery power, as it is a power, hath for her laſt end, her act or worke, as euery ſcience hath of it owne nature for her laſt end the knowledge of her obiect, and euery art the effecting of her work, (as the laſt end of naturall philoſophie is to know the ſecrets of nature, and of Phiſike to cure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the body from diſeaſes) although man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in whom that power, art, or ſcience doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, doth intend a farther end. Whereupon <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> doth well affirme, <hi>that the will to ſee hath no other end then ſeeing: The will,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="c" place="margin">Lib. <hi>11.</hi> de Trin. cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>to ſee hath ſeeing for her end, and the will to ſee this thing hath for her end the ſeeing of this thing: The will therefore to ſee a skarre doth deſire her end, that is, the ſeeing of a skarre, and no further doth appertaine to her.</hi> Wherefore, as the Philoſophers do diſtinguiſh betwixt the laſt end of any art or worke, and the laſt end of the artificer, or worker, ſo we alſo ought to diſtinguiſh betwixt the laſt end of the power it ſelfe, and of him, in whom the power doth reſide. It is called the laſt end of the worke, for that the worke is in that laſtly ended, and not the laſt end of the worker, for that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker doth not referre all that is his to that end, as a thing to be deſired and loued aboue all things.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>3. I grant therefore that the end of a Chriſtian Prince, who hath temporall power, is ſpirituall and eternall felicitie, to which Chriſtians ought to refer all their actions, and the vſe not only of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, but alſo of the ciuill power, but withall I affirme, that the laſt end, which the ciuill power hath
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20729:95"/>
                     <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature, is only temporall peace and quietneſſe, in the getting and conſeruing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of it owne nature it doth laſtly reſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this reaſon it is not neceſſary, that the ciuill power it ſelfe be <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to the Eccleſiaſticall, but onely accidentally and by the intention of him, who referreth tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peace to eternall felicitie in that maner as I haue declared. To that aſſertion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> powers are ſo ſubordained as their ends are ſubordained (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that place hee rather ſaith, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ds are ſubordained, as powers are ſubordained) I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is to be vnderſtood of thoſe ends, which powers haue of their owne nature, and not of the ends of the men, in whom the powers doe reſide.</q>
Thus I anſwered in my <hi>Apologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Now you ſhall ſee how inſufficiently <hi>Card. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> in his <hi>Schulckenius</hi> replyeth to this anſwere. <hi>I anſwere</hi> ſaith he,<note n="d" place="margin">Pag. <hi>329.</hi> ad num. <hi>162.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that not euery temporall or corporall end is ſubordained</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of it owne nature to a ſpirituall end, my</hi> Aduerſary Widdrington <hi>doth ſay, but hee doth not proue.</hi> But <hi>firſt,</hi> who knoweth not, that it doth not appertaine to the Anſwerer to proue, for to this the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent only is tyed, and for the Anſwearer it ſufficeth by granting, denying, or diſtinguiſhing for him to anſwere.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I did not conceiue, that this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being ſo cleere and manifeſt of it ſelfe, needed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofe at all, and therefore I little thought, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned man would euer deny the ſame: for that, according to the knowne principles of Philoſophy and Diuinitie, no naturall thing can intrinſically, and of it own nature be referred to a thing, which is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and aboue the courſe of nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore betwixt naturall and ſupernaturall things, there can be no naturall ſubordination. Now that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peace in a temporall common-wealth is a naturall
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20729:96"/>
thing, and eternall felicitie, which conſiſteth in the cleere viſion and fruition of almighty God, is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and goeth beyond the bounds, limits, and order of nature, no man can make any doubt; and therefore temporall peace cannot of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be referred to eternall felicity; but onely by the will and intention of man, who by the helpe of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall light and grace doth referre it, direct it, and eleuate it to that ſupernaturall end.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And for this cauſe alſo it is very cleere, that temporall power cannot of it owne nature bee refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to true ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall power, for that it is ſupernatural, and giuen onely by <hi>God,</hi> as he is the Author, not of nature, but of ſupernaturall grace. Yea out of Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne grounds it may be cleerely conuinced, that the temporall power among Chriſtians is not of it own nature ſubiect, and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to the ſpirituall power, and conſequently, that temporall peace, which is the end of temporall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is not of it own nature referred or ordained to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity, which is the laſt create end of the ſpiritual power, for that according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Ethic. cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>ends are ſo ſubordained, as their powers are ſubordained.</hi> His firſt ground is, for that in his <hi>Controuerſies</hi> he affirmeth<note n="f" place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Rom. Pont. cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>that in Infidels there is true ciuill power without any order, or relation to any true ſpirituall, or Eccleſiaſticall power,</hi> and conſequently in Infidels the ciuill power is not ſubiect or ſubordained to the ſpirituall, for where there is no order, or relation, there can be no ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſubordination, for that ſubiection and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation doth neceſſarily imply an order, relation, or reference to that, to which any thing is ſubordained.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seeing therefore that Chriſtian Religion doth not take away true ciuill power, as <hi>Card. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himſelfe alſo in another place affirmeth<note n="g" place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Rom. Pont. cap. <hi>29.</hi>
                  </note>, neither is the true nature, or any intrinſecall propertie of the ciuil power changed or altered, for that it is in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20729:96"/>
or an Infidell, in this ſubiect, or in that, it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily followeth, that if true ciuill power bee not of it own nature ſubiect, or ſubordained in Infidels to true ſpirituall, or Eccleſiaſtical power, it is not alſo in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it own nature ſubiect or ſubordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to true ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall power. This onely alteration hath ciuill power for being in this ſubiect, or in that, in Infidels, or in Chriſtians, that Chriſtians ought, according to the true grounds of Chriſtian Religion, referre it by the aide of true ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall faith to a true ſupernaturall end, to which Infidels, who want true ſupernaturall faith, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it: but this alteration is extrinſecall or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, not intrinſecall or eſſentiall, neither doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the nature of the ciuill power it ſelfe, but from the wil &amp; intention of him, in whom true ciuill power doth reſide. As likewiſe the nature or intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call properties of other accidents, as of Muſick, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and ſuch like, are not altered, or changed by the changing or altering of their ſubiects, &amp; for that they are in Chriſtians, or in Infidels, although a Chriſtian Muſician will refer &amp; ordaine his Muſick to the true worſhip of God, &amp; an Infidel to the honor of his Idol.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The ſecond ground, which <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> layeth to prooue, that the temporall power among Chriſtians is not <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ſpirituall power, is, for that in his <hi>Schulcke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> he affirmeth<note n="h" place="margin">Pag. <hi>276.</hi> ad nu. <hi>140.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>That among the Heathen Romanes, the ciuill power was ſubiect to the ſpiritual power of a falſe religion:</hi> and a little beneath, <hi>if the ciuill power,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be ioyned with a falſe Eccleſiaſticall power, that is of a falſe Religion, as it was in the Heathen Romane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, then it is actually ſubordained to a falſe Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power, and if it bee ioyned with a true Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power, as in the Chriſtian and Catholike Church, then it is actually ſubordained to a true Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall power.</hi> Now what Philoſopher, or Diuine
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:20729:97"/>
will affirme that a true ciuill power is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature actually ordained, ſubordained, or refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a falſe Eccleſiaſticall power, that is of a falſe Religion, or to the worſhipping of falſe Gods. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſubiection, ſubordination, or relation of true ciuill power to the ſpirituall, proceedeth from the intention of him, in whom the ciuill power doth reſide, who according to his faith and religion (bee it true or falſe) referreth his true ciuill power to a true or falſe Religion, to a true or falſe worſhipping of God, and not from the nature, or any intrinſecal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the true ciuill power it ſelfe which, as it is the ſame in Infidels and Chriſtians, or in whatſoeuer ſubiect it be ſo alſo of it own nature hath the ſame end as well in Infidels as in Chriſtians, to wit, temporall peace, to which of it owne nature it is alwaies refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And therefore I doe not onely ſay: but alſo I doe cleerely prooue, and that out of Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> owne grounds, to which neuertheleſſe I being only an anſwerer, and not an opponent, was not tied, that neither the ciuil power, being only a naturall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, nor the end of ciuill power, which is temporal peace, being onely a naturall end, is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubiect, or ſubordained to a true ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall power or end, but onely by the intenſion of him, in whom the ciuill power doth reſide.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now you ſhal ſee how wel D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the contrarie. <hi>But wee prooue the contrary,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="i" place="margin">Pag. <hi>329.</hi> ad nu. <hi>162.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the end of the ſpirituall common-wealth is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting ſaluation, which is the laſt end; the end of the temporall common-wealth is the peace of the Citie, or Kingdome, which is not the laſt end, but a mediate end. But all ends are ſubordained</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the laſt end, and in vertue of it they doe mooue, as all efficient cauſes are ſubordained</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of their owne nature to the firſt efficient cauſe, and in vertue of it they worke whatſoeuer they doe worke. See S.</hi> Thomas 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:20729:97"/>10. But to this argument I anſwered before, that the laſt create end of the ſpirituall common-wealth, which is a companie of men vnited by Baptiſme, in that manner as I declared before, is eternal ſaluation, to which they ought to referre all their powers both temporall and ſpirituall, and all their actions both in generall and particular: but I denied, that the laſt end of the temporall power it ſelfe, although it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned in one &amp; the ſelfe ſame ſubiect with true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power, is eternall ſaluation, but onely temporall peace in the common-wealth, to which of it owne nature it is onely referred, as to her laſt end, although by the intention of him, in whom true ciuill and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power doth reſide, it ought to bee referred to eternall ſaluation, as to the laſt end of a Chriſtian man, but not as to the laſt end, which the temporall power it ſelfe hath <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> proued the contrary, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his <hi>Reply</hi> to my anſwere hee in expreſſe words confirmeth what I haue ſaid. For in his anſwere to the authority, which I brought out of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> hee affirmeth, <hi>That the laſt end of one particular will, power, or ſcience is their act or operation,</hi> and therefore it cannot of it owne nature be referred to eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to the laſt end, vnleſſe D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> will admit, that the ſame particular power hath of it owne nature two laſt ends, or a later end then the laſt, which implieth a manifeſt contradiction; but it muſt onely be referred extrinſecally to eternall ſaluation by the intention of him, in whom the particular power doth reſide.</p>
               <p n="11">11 True it is, <hi>That all create ends are ſubordained</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of their nature to that end, which is ſimply and abſolutely the laſt end, and doe moue in vertue thereof, as all efficient cauſes are ſubordained</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of their owne nature to that, which is ſimply and abſolutely the firſt efficient cauſe, and in vertue thereof they doe worke what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20729:98"/>
they do worke:</hi> But this efficient and finall cauſe of all created things is not the eternall ſaluation of men, but God a mighty, who is <hi>Alpha</hi> &amp; <hi>Omega, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium</hi> &amp; <hi>finis,</hi> the beginning and end of all created things, both naturall and ſupernaturall, both vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and reaſonable, of accidents and ſubſtances, of all powers and of all things wherein powers doe reſide, and who is glorified not onely by the eternall ſaluation, but alſo by the eternall damnation of men. God alone is ſimply and abſolutely the laſt end of all created things, to whome all naturall things are of their owne nature laſtly referred, as to the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and laſt end of nature, and ſupernaturall things, as to the firſt Authour and laſt end of grace and glory: Neither can naturall things of their owne nature be referred to any ſupernaturall create end, as is eternall ſaluation, but onely by the will and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him: who by the helpe of ſupernatural grace ſhall referre and eleuate them aboue their nature to a ſupernaturall end. Neither doth S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in that place affirme the contrary, but rather moſt cleerely confirmeth, what I haue ſaid: for there he only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth, how euery man by his wil, intention, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, referreth all good things, which hee deſireth to the laſt end.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Marke now, I beſeech you, D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> his ſecond proofe, which is no whit better then the former. <hi>Moreouer is not the body,</hi> ſaith he<note n="k" place="margin">

And whereas my Aduerſarie</hi> Widdrington <hi>ſeemeth to ſay, that euery temporall end is</hi> per accidens, <hi>or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally referred to a ſpiritual end: as by man, who worketh for an end, it is ordained to a ſpirituall end, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe.

                  <hi>becauſe the bodie and ſoule doe compound one ſubſtantiall thing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of two eſſentiall parts, whereof the bodie is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as the Philoſophers doe call it, <hi>and the ſoule the forme; and this is the reaſon, why the body is</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of it owne nature, for the ſoule and ſubiect are ſubordained to it;</hi> for that all Philoſophers doe grant, that euery matter is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature for the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiall forme, wherewith it maketh one eſſentiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; <hi>but the temporall and ſpirituall powers doe not make one totall bodie</hi> or common-wealth, <hi>whereof the temporall power is inſteed of the matter, and the ſpirituall inſteede of the forme.</hi> And therefore D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> had ſmall reaſon to make that interrogation, ſeeing that hee himſelfe did a little before ſet downe this my reaſon, which doth fully ſatisfie the aforeſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Neither did I ſay, as <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth me to ſay, although a little before, as you haue ſeene<note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 4.</note>, he related my words otherwiſe, <hi>that euery temporall end</hi> is <hi>per accidens,</hi> or accidentally <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a ſpirituall end,</hi> but I only affirmed, <hi>that not euery temporall end,</hi> and in particular <hi>temporall peace</hi> among Chriſtians, which is the laſt end of the ciuill power it ſelfe, <hi>is not</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of it owne nature ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eternall ſaluation,</hi> which is the laſt end of the ſpirituall power, but onely <hi>per accidens,</hi> or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, as by the will and intention of a Chriſtian man,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20729:99"/>
it is ordained to eternall ſaluation, which is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall end, and therefore not proportionate to the nature of any ciuill or naturall power. And although I had ſaid, that euery temporall end is <hi>per accidens</hi> referred to a ſpirituall end, yet <hi>D: Schulckenius</hi> could not but perceiue by the whole ſcope of my words, that my meaning was to ſay, that euery temporall end, which is referred to a ſpirituall end, is not <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature referred to that ſpirituall end, but <hi>per accidens,</hi> and extrinſecally by the will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of man, who referreth it to that ſpirituall end, for no man can bee ſo ignorant as to imagine, that Chriſtians doe alwaies referre and ordaine all temporall ends to the eternall ſaluation of their ſoules.</p>
               <p n="15">15 True it is, that all naturall things belonging to man are of ſuch a nature, as that by the intention of man they may be ordained to good or bad ends, and temporall peace, which is a naturall end, may by the will of man, being aided with ſupernaturall grace, be referred and eleuated to eternall felicitie, which is a ſupernaturall end; and this is agreeable to reaſon, and to the nature of man, as he is a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or led by reaſon, to ordaine, referre, and eleuate all naturall things, which are in his power, when by the helpe of grace he is able ſo to doe, to true ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ends, and to eternall felicitie, for which hee was created, and to doe otherwiſe were againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and againſt the nature of man, as hee is endued with reaſon: But that naturall powers, or ends, ſhould be <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of their owne nature <hi>actually</hi> referred, and eleuated to ſupernaturall powers or ends, much leſſe ſupernaturall powers or ends, ſhould be referred and depreſſed to naturall powers or vicious ends, but only by the good or wicked intention of a man, in whoſe power it is to ordaine a good thing to a bad end, a naturall power to a ſupernaturall, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe,

this truly I thinke no man of any learning can conceiue, and before I haue clearely proued, that it is altogether falſe.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to thoſe words, which I alledged out of <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> and to the reſt which follow in my An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>D.

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 332.</note>, <hi>It is true, that the laſt end of one particular will, power, or ſcience is their act, but it is not true, that the laſt end of one particular will, power, or ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not referred</hi> per ſe <hi>and of their owne nature to that end, which is ſimply the laſt end, but onely by accident by the intention of him, who hath that will, power, or ſcience. And this not only</hi> S. Thomas <hi>in the place cited doth teach, but alſo</hi> S. Auſtin <hi>in the place alledged by</hi> Widdrington, <hi>to wit,</hi> lib. 11. de Trinit. cap. 6. <hi>All theſe,</hi> ſaith S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, <hi>and ſuch like wills haue firſt their ends, which are referred to the end of that will, whereby we are willing to liue happily.</hi> Thus S. Auſtin, <hi>who, when he ſubioyneth,</hi> the will therefore to ſee a skar doth deſire hir end, to wit, the ſeeing of a skar, and farther doth not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to hir, <hi>he ſignifieth indeed, that the ſeeing of a skar is the laſt end of the will to ſee a skar, but hee doth not deny, that the ſeeing of a skar is</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of it owne nature referred to a higher end of a higher will, and that to an other, vntill we come to that end, which is</hi> ſimply <hi>the laſt end. For all good ends are of their owne nature refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that end, which is</hi> ſimply <hi>the laſt end, and as ends are of their owne nature ſubordained one to an other, ſo alſo it is neceſſarie, that wills, powers, or ſciences be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained. As for example, (to perſist in</hi> S. Auſtins <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) a man hath many wills, one to ſee a skar, an other, by ſeeing the skar to finde the wound; the third, by fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the wound, to convince and correct him, who did inflict the wound; the fourth, by correcting him to heale the wound of his ſoule; the fift, by this act of charitie to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit life euerlaſting; it is certaine, that euery one of theſe wills haue their proper end, neither any thing farther doth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20729:100"/>
appertaine to them, but it is alſo certaine, that the end of the first will is referred to the end of the ſecond will, and the firſt will it ſelfe ſubordained to the ſecond, and ſo in order.</hi> Thus <hi>D. Schulckenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17 But truly in my opinion <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> doth in this Reply both plainly contradict himſelfe, and alſo clearely confirme my Anſwer. And <hi>firſt</hi> no man can make any doubt, but that all wills, powers, ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ends, and things whatſoeuer are <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of their owne nature referred to that, which is <hi>ſimply</hi> the laſt end; but that, which is <hi>ſimply</hi> the laſt end of all things, is not the eternall felicitie of any creature, but <hi>God almightie,</hi> who alone is <hi>ſimply</hi> the efficient and finall cauſe of all things, and <hi>made all things,</hi> both hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and hell, <hi>for himſelfe,</hi> Prouerb. 16. and who is glorified not only in the eternall ſaluation, but alſo in the eternall damnation both of Men and Angells: And this <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> can not deny, and he might haue ſeene the ſame confirmed by <hi>S. Thomas</hi> in the ſame queſtion cited by him <hi>ar.</hi> 8. but more expreſſely 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>, <hi>part. q.</hi> 44. <hi>ar.</hi> 4. where he proueth, that becauſe <hi>God</hi> almightie is the firſt efficient cauſe of all things, he muſt of neceſſitie be alſo the laſt end of all things: and by <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> alſo in infinite places.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Secondly,</hi> whereas D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that the laſt end of one particular will, power, or ſcience is their act,</hi> and withall, <hi>that this laſt end is</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of it owne nature referred to a further create end,</hi> (whereof only he ſpeaketh) and conſequently that particular will or power muſt alſo be referred to that farther end, and ſo it muſt be referred to a farther end then to the laſt, he cleerely contradicteth himſelfe. For how can any act be <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature be the laſt end of one particular will, power or ſcience, and yet this laſt end bee <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature referred to a farther end, ſeeing that according to the approoued grounds of philoſophie, which kinde of arguing the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20729:100"/>
Logicians call <hi>Sorites,</hi> or <hi>à primo ad vltimum, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the firſt to the laſt,</hi> euery particular will, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ſcience, which is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to any particular end, is alſo referred to all thoſe ends, to which that particular end is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature referred? As for example, if any particular will be <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature referred to the ſeeing of a skar, and the ſeeing of a skarre bee <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature referred to the finding out of the wound, and the finding out of the wound be <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature referred to the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of him who did inflict the wound &amp;c. then <hi>à primo ad vltimum, from the firſt to the laſt,</hi> the will to ſee a skarre muſt <hi>per ſe,</hi> and and of it owne nature bee referred to the correcting of him, who did inflict the wound &amp;c. Wherefore if the ſeeing of a skarre bee the laſt end of the will to ſee a skarre, as D. <hi>Schulcke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> heere affirmeth, it cannot <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature bee referred to a farther end, vnleſſe hee will grant, that the ſame will ſhall haue <hi>per ſe</hi> a farther end, then the laſt, which is a flat contradiction; but if it be referred to a farther end, it is onely by <hi>accident,</hi> and extrinſecally by the intention of the ſeer, who refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſeeing of a skarre to a farther end, then it hath of it owne nature. Neither doth S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or S. <hi>Austin</hi> affirme the contrary, but confirme what I haue ſayd.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For although S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth affirme, <hi>that all theſe &amp; ſuch like wils haue their proper ends, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the end of that will, wherby we deſire to liue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, and to come to that life, which is not referred to any other thing, but it doth of it ſelfe ſatisfie the Louer,</hi> yet he doth not ſay, that theſe proper ends, are <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of their owne nature referred to euerlaſting happineſſe, but he doth rather in expreſſe words ſay, that they are by ſome particular will, or intention of man referred to euerlaſting happineſſe. And therefore he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20729:101"/>
                  <hi>that all wils are well connected together, if that will be good, whereunto all the reſt be referred, but if that bee bad, all the other wils are bad.</hi> So that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> cannot be ſo vnderſtood, that all thoſe wils are <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of their owne nature referred to a good, or to a bad will, for that a will, which of it owne nature is good can not of it owne nature be referred to a bad will, or to a bad end. And therefore when S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the will to ſee a skarre hath for her proper end the ſeeing of a skarre, and no farther appertaineth to her,</hi> hee vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the laſt end, which the will to ſee a skar hath <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature, and when he ſaith, <hi>that it may be referred to a farther end, good or bad,</hi> he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth of a farther end, not which it hath of <hi>it owne nature,</hi> but which it hath by ſome other will or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may be good or bad, according as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth all the other wils to a good or bad end.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Moreouer thoſe examples, which D. <hi>Schulcke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> bringeth in the end of his <hi>Reply,</hi> doe moſt cleerly confirme my anſwer, and confute his owne <hi>Reply.</hi> For if a man haue many wils, one to ſee a skarre, another by ſeeing the skar to prooue the wound, the third by prouing the wound to correct him who inflicted the wound and ſo foorth, it is certaine, that the ſeeing of the skarre is not <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature referred and ordained to prooue the wound, and to correct him, who did inflict the wound, but onely by the will and intention of the ſeer, who referreth it to thoſe ends, in whoſe choice it is to refer the ſeeing of a skar to other ends: neither is their any naturall or neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry connexion betwixt the ſeeing of the skar, the proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the wound, and the correcting of him, who did inflict it: for that a skar may be ſeene for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends, and not at all for thoſe. Beſides, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the courſe of nature, that the ſeeing of a skar, which is a naturall thing, ſhould be <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it own nature referred &amp; ordained to the euerlaſting
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20729:101"/>
happineſſe of man, which is a thing aboue nature, and beyond the courſe of naturall things, and therefore it is only <hi>by accident,</hi> and extrinſecally by the intention and will of man referred and ordained to that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall end. And thus you ſee, that I haue not only clearely anſwered to this <hi>firſt argument</hi> of Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> which had been ſufficient for me, who tooke vpon mee only to anſwere, and not to proue, but alſo haue clearely prooued, that although eternall felicitie, be the laſt create end of man, yet temporall peace, and not eternall felicitie is the laſt create end, to which temporall power euen among Chriſtians is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature referred.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Neuertheleſſe, I will go a little farther with <hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> and grant him for Diſputation ſake, which hitherto he hath not in my iudgement ſo much as <hi>probably</hi> proued, that thereby the weakeneſſe alſo of this his firſt pretended demonſtration may the more eaſily appeare; to wit, that not only the Eccleſiaſticall, but alſo the ciuill power among Chriſtians is <hi>per ſe;</hi> and of it owne nature, and not only by the will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Chriſtian men referred to the true eternall ſaluation of man, as to the laſt end not only of man, but of the ciuill power it ſelfe, yet it can not therefore from hence by any neceſſarie conſequence bee infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the ciuill power among Chriſtians is <hi>per ſe;</hi> and of it owne nature ſubiect and ſubordained to the ſpirituall power, or that the end of the ciuill power is ſubordained to the end of the ſpirituall power, but at the moſt, that both of them haue one &amp; the ſelfe ſame laſt end, to wit, the eternall felicitie of man, to which the ſpirituall power leadeth Chriſtian men by ſpirituall meanes, to wit, by ſpirituall directions, lawes, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and the ciuill power by ciuill meanes, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, lawes, and puniſhments: And therefore there is no ſubordination of ends, betwixt the ends of the ſpirituall and temporall power, and conſequently no
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20729:102"/>
ſubordination of powers, but they haue both one laſt end, to wit, euerlaſting happineſſe, although diuerſe waies, or meanes to attaine thereunto, not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diuerſe lines in a circle, which doe end all in one center, and yet one line is not ſubordained to another, although all of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e tend by diuerſe waies to the ſame center. And therefore by this firſt argument <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> hath not ſufficiently proued, that the ciuill power among Chriſtians is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubordained to the ſpirituall, or the proper end of the ciuil power, which is her act tending to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall peace, ſubordained to the proper end of the ſpirituall power, which is alſo her act tending laſtly to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting happineſſe; although I ſhould grant him, that both of them haue <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of their owne nature one and the ſelfe ſame laſt end, which is the eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, in whom thoſe powers doe reſide. And therefore D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> perceiuing belike the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of my anſwere, and the weakneſſe of his owne Reply, flieth to a ſecond <hi>Reply,</hi> which neuertheleſſe is as inſufficient as the former.</p>
               <p n="22">22. But <hi>although we ſhould grant,</hi> ſaith he<note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 333.</note>, to <hi>Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, that the end of the ciuill power is not referred</hi> per ſe, <hi>and of it owne nature to the end of the ſpirituall, but onely by the intention of the Prince, in whom the ciuill power doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, yet the argument which</hi> Card. Bellarmine <hi>brought from the ſubiection of the temporall power to the ſpirituall, to proue that the ſpirituall Prince could not onely command temporall Princes, but alſo diſpoſe of temporalls in order to ſpirituall good, would be moſt ſtrong and good. For a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian temporall Prince ought to referre the publike peace, which is the end of ciuill power, to the eternall peace and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of himſelfe and of his people, which is the end of the ſpirituall power. And therefore hee ought to ſubiect and ſubordaine the end of his power to the end of the power of the ſpirituall Prince. But as he ought to ſubiect and ſubordaine end to end, ſo alſo power to power. Wherefore hee ought not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20729:102"/>
to take it in ill part, if he be truly a Chriſtian Prince, that the</hi> Pope <hi>by his ſpirituall power direct, and correct the ciuill power, and that ſo the ſword be vnder the ſword, and in the Chriſtian common wealth there be order, peace, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whiles Superiours do rule inferiours, and inferiours be ſubiect to Superiours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. But in this Reply there lie hidden ſome cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning equiuocations, and the moſt that it proueth, as oftentimes heretofore I haue ſignified, is, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall power or ſword, or rather temporall Princes who haue temporall power, and beare the temporall ſword, are in ſpirituall cauſes) whether of their owne nature, or by ſome accidentall circumſtance they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſpirituall) to the ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall power, by which they are to be directed &amp; corrected, not in meere temporals, but only in ſpirituals, not by temporall lawes, or with temporall puniſhments, which doe belong onely to the temporall power, but only by Eccleſiaſticall lawes or directions, and with Eccleſiaſticall or ſpirituall puniſhments or corrections, which onely do appertaine to the Eccleſiaſticall or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power.</p>
               <p n="24">24. True it is, that eternall ſaluation is the laſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate end not only of the ſpirituall, but alſo of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power among Chriſtians, ſeeing that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes are bound by the law of Chriſt to referre their temporall power, and the vſe thereof, not onely to temporall peace in the common weath, which is the laſt end, which temporall power hath <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature, but alſo to the eternall peace and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of themſelues, and of their people; And therefore there is here no ſubordination of ends betwixt the temporall power and the ſpirituall, and conſequently in this reſpect no ſubordination of powers, as D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> doth here from thence inferre, but aſwell the ciuill power among Chriſtians, as the ſpirituall, haue one and the ſelfe ſame laſt end (whether it bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall

to one power, and extrinſecall to the other, or intrinſecall to both as I declared before) to which the temporall power by temporall lawes, directions, and corrections, and the ſpirituall power by ſpirituall lawes, directions, and corrections or puniſhments are by the law of Chriſt bound to direct, and lead all Chriſtians.</p>

                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note>, that Kings and Biſhops, Clearkes and Laikes, being diuerſe waies conſidered, doe make two totall, and not onely one totall body or common-wealth. For as they are referred to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall or ſpirituall power of the chiefe viſible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, to whom all Chriſtians are ſubiect in ſpirituals, they make one totall body or common-wealth, to wit, the Catholike Church, which is the ſpirituall Kingdome and myſticall body of Chriſt, but as they are referred to the ciuill power of temporall Princes, to whom all inferiour Clerkes and Laikes are ſubiect in temporals, as all members are ſubiect to the head,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20729:105"/>
they make another body or common-wealth, to wit, earthly kingdomes, as before I declared more at large. And this is ſufficient to ſhew the weakneſſe of this <hi>ſecond argument,</hi> the <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition thereof being cleerely falſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

                  <q>that although in euery body the members are vnited and connected ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately, or mediately to the head, vpon whom they all depend, yet that in euery body all the members doe depend one vpon the other, there is no man ſo ignorant that will affirme: for neither one foote doth depend vpon the other, nor one arme vpon the other, nor one ſhoulder vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but they are connected to ſome third either immediately by themſelues, or to other members, to which they adhere. May it not, I pray you, by the ſame manner of arguing, and by the very ſame argument be concluded thus: The armes or euery man are members of one body, but in euery bodie the members are connected, and depending one vpon the other, but it cannot rightly bee ſaid that the right arme doth depend vpon the left, therfore the left arme of euerie man doth depend vpon the right, and is ſubiect vnto it.

For the ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall power, whereof we ſpeake, are of a diuerſe kinde, as it is manifest,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20729:105"/>
and words are to bee vnderſtood according to the matter, which is treated of, otherwiſe there could not bee any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration ſo certaine, againſt which there could not bee brought ſome cauill. Therefore Kingly power, which is principall in his kinde, if it compound one body with the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power, which alſo in his kinde is principall, muſt of neceſſitie be either ſubiect, or ſuperiour, leaſt that in one bodie there be two heads; and ſeeing that it is manifeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the Pope is head of the Church in ſteede of Chriſt, it doth plainely follow, that a King muſt either bee no member of this body, or elſe hee muſt bee ſubiect to the Pope, and in the ſame manner the ciuill power, which doth chiefely reſide in the King, muſt either bee ſubiect to the ſpirituall, which doth chiefely reſide in the Pope,</hi> or elſe <hi>it muſt remaine out of the Church; in that manner as a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cannot be in the body, which doth not depend vpon the hand, nor a hand, which doth not depend vpon the arme, nor an arme, which doth not depend vpon the ſhoulder, nor a ſhoulder, which doth not depend vpon the head.</hi>

                  </q> which are two diſtinct arguments, yet both of them fallacious, and inſufficient to proue, that the temporall power it ſelfe, or which is all one, that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Kings in temporall cauſes are ſubiect to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as you haue ſeene before.</p>

earth was head in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, neither did Catholike faith euer teach, that he was head in ciuill cauſes.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THe third argument,</hi> which <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> bringeth to proue, <hi>that the ciuill power among Chriſtians, not only as it is Chriſtian, but alſo as it is ciuill, is ſubiect, and ſubordained to the Eccleſiaſticall as it is Eccleſiasticall,</hi> is this: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Rom: Pont. cap: <hi>7.</hi>

                  <hi>if the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gouernment hinder the ſpirituall good, the Prince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of all men, is bound to change that manner of gouernment, euen with the hinderance of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall good, therefore it is a ſigne that the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Neither doth he ſatisfie, that ſhould anſwer, that a Prince is bound to change that manner of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not for the ſubordination to the ſpirituall power, but onely for order of charitie, by which wee are bound to preferre greater goods before loſſer. For in regard of the order of charitie, one common-wealth is not bound to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer detriment, that an other common-wealth more noble doe not ſuffer the like detriment. And one priuate man, who is bound to giue all his goods for the conſeruation of his owne common-wealth, is not bound to doe the like for an other common-wealth, although the more noble. Seeing therefore that the temporall common-wealth is bound to ſuffer detriment for the ſpiritual common-weatlh, it is a ſigne that they are not two diuerſe common-wealths, but parts of one and the ſame common-wealth, and one ſubiect to the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Neither alſo is it of force, if one ſhould ſay, that a temporall</hi> Prince <hi>is bound to ſuffer detriment for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, not in regard of any ſubiection of the temporall commonwealth to the ſpirituall common wealth, but becauſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:20729:112"/>
otherwiſe he ſhould hurt his ſubiects, to whom it is hurtfull to looſe ſpiritualls for temporalls. For although thoſe men, who are not his ſubiects, but are of an other kingdome, ſhould ſuffer any notable hurt in ſpiritualls, for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in temporalls of ſome Chriſtian King, he is bound to change his manner of gouernment, whereof no other reaſon can be giuen, but that they are members of the ſame body, and one ſubiect to the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By this argument <hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> as you ſee, laboureth to proue two things, the <hi>one</hi> is, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lay-men, and Cleargie-men doe make one totall body, which is the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is head, for of this no Catholike maketh any doubt, but alſo that the temporall &amp; ſpirituall power themſelues, or which is all one, the temporall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall common wealth, as they conſiſt of temporall and ſpirituall power, are parts or this totall body cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme viſible head. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that not only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes are in ſpirituals ſubiect to the ſupreme ſpirituall Paſtour, but alſo, that the temporall power itſelfe, as it is temporall, is among Chriſtians ſubiect to the ſpirituall power, as it is ſpirituall, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that temporall Princes not onely in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, but alſo in all temporalls are ſubiect to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power. <q>But neither of theſe can bee rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this argument, as I ſhewed in my <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>

For if temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment doe hinder ſpirituall good, the temporall Prince is bound to change that manner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment euen with detriment of temporall good, not for that the temporall power is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubiect to the ſpirituall, as though of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall power were made <hi>formally</hi> one politike body, but for both the reaſons alledged by

                  <q>5. The <hi>firſt reaſon</hi> is <hi>for the order of charitie, by which we are bound to prefer greater goods before leſſer.</hi> To the <hi>Reply,</hi> which Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> made to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, I anſwered thus, that although for the order of charity one common wealth is not bound to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer detriment, that an other common wealth more noble doe not ſuffer the like detriment, yet in caſe that both common wealths bee ſubiect to one Prince, or that the Prince of the leſſe noble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth be alſo a ſubiect of the more noble, then that Prince is bound for order of charitie, all other things being alike, to preferre the more noble common-wealth before the leſſe noble. And although one priuate man, who is bound to giue all his goods for the conſeruation of his owne common-wealth, bee not bound to doe the like for an other common-wealth, although the more noble, yet in caſe that the ſame priuate man ſhould at the ſame time bee a Citizen of both common-wealths, if he be bound to giue all his goods for the conſeruation of the leſſe noble common wealth, whereof he is a Citizen, he is much more bound for the ſame order of charitie, to giue all his goods for the conſeruation of the more noble common wealth, to which alſo he is ſubiect. And this is the very caſe in this preſent queſtion. For the ſpirituall and ciuill power, and the common wealths which they compound, are ſo vnited and connected among Chriſtians, that euery Chriſtian is a Citizen of both common wealths, and both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths may be ſubiect to the ſame Prince, as appeareth in the <hi>Pope,</hi> who is the ſpirituall Prince or Paſtour of the whole Chriſtian world, and alſo a temporall Prince of ſome Prouinces thereof.</q>

alſo the ſpirituall kingdome, myſticall body or Church of Chriſt conſiſting onely of ſpirituall power is a <hi>politike body.</hi> Wherefore by the name of a <hi>politike body</hi> I vnderſtood a common-wealth in generall, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were temporall, ſpirituall, or mixt of both, as any man, who is not deſirous to cauill, may eaſily perceiue by all thoſe anſwers and aſſertions, which I did ſo often inculcate concerning the vnion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of theſe two powers. So that my meaning in that place onely was to deny, that the temporall and ſpirituall power, as they are referred to the viſible heads and ſubiects of both powers, doe make <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally one totall common-wealth,</hi> but onely <hi>materially,</hi> for that the ſame Chriſtian men, who haue temporall power or temporall ſubiection, doe make one ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Kingdome or Church of Chriſt, but not <hi>formally,</hi> as they haue temporall power, or temporall ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for ſo they make onely temporall and earthly kingdomes, but <hi>formally</hi> as they haue temporall and ſpirituall power, temporall and ſpirituall ſubiection, and are referred to the viſible heads thereof, they make two totall bodies or common-wealths, as before I haue declared more at large.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Secondly,</hi> although it be true, that temporall and ſpirituall power, that is, <hi>Kings and Biſhops, Clerks and Laikes,</hi> as D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> expoundeth thoſe words (which neuertheleſſe is a very improper accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe words, for that temporall and ſpirituall power in <hi>abſtracto</hi> doth ſignifie Kings and Biſhops, Clerkes and Laikes as they haue temporall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power) <hi>doe make one Church, one Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, one people, one kingdome or myſticall body of Chriſt,</hi> yet this was not all that, which <hi>Card.

And therefore the temporall, and ſpirituall power, or Kings and Biſhops, Clearkes and Laikes, as they are referred to the viſible heads heere on earth, doe neither make one politike or temporall body, nor one ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall body, nor one total common-wealth conſiſting of both powers, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is head, but they doe make <hi>formally,</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> two totall bodies or common-wealths, to wit, the ſpirituall kingdome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth onely of ſpirituall power, and the earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of this Chriſtian world, which conſiſteth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of temporall and ciuill authority, both which bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are commonly ſignified by the name of the Chriſtian world, or Chriſtian common-wealth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all things are well ordered, and rightly diſpoſed, and therefore ſuperiours are aboue inferiours, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours are ſubiect to ſuperiours; but in temporall cauſes temporall power, whereof temporall Princes are the head, hath the preheminence not onely ouer Lay-men, but alſo ouer Cleargy-men, and in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cauſes the ſpirituall power, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20729:116"/>
head, is ſuperiour, and to confound theſe two powers, were to breake all good order, as before I alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. And therfore for good reaſon I granted the antecedent propoſition of <hi>Card. Bellarmines</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and denied his conſequence.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But <hi>fourthly</hi> obſerue, <hi>good Reader,</hi> another palpable vntruth, which D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> in this place affirmeth. <hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> as you haue ſeene, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by his third argument to proue, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power as it is temporall, is among Chriſtians ſubiect to the ſpirituall power, as it is ſpirituall; and his argument was this: <hi>If the temporall gouernment hinder the ſpirituall good, the Prince is bound to change that manner of gouernment, euen with the hinderance of the temporall good, therefore it is a ſigne that the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall..</hi> The antecedent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I did grant, and I denied his conſequence. Now <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that for this cauſe I denyed his conſequence, for that of the temporall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power is not made formally one politike body,</hi> which is very vntrue. For although I ſhould acknowledge, as in very deede I doe, that the temporall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power, as they are referred to Chriſt the inviſible and celeſtiall head, doe make <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> one totall body, or common-wealth, conſiſting of both powers, which may be called the Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, but more properly the Chriſtian world, yet I would and doe denie his conſequence: and the reaſon hereof I alledged before, for that they are not <hi>eſſentiall parts</hi> of this totall bodie, as the bodie &amp; ſoule are of man, but <hi>integrall</hi> parts, as two ſhoulders, two ſides, hands, feete, eyes, eares, &amp;c. are <hi>integrall</hi> parts of mans bodie, and doe not make an <hi>eſſentiall,</hi> but an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrall</hi> compound, in which kinde of compound it is not neceſſarie, as I ſhewed before<note n="k" place="margin">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20729:117"/>
as I doe, that <hi>temporall and ſpirituall power</hi> doe make <hi>formally</hi> one politike bodie, or temporall common wealth, taking <hi>temporall and ſpirituall power</hi> in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſenſe, as is declared by <hi>D. Schulckenius,</hi> to wit, for <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Biſhops, Clerks</hi> and <hi>Laikes,</hi> who diuerſe waies conſidered, doe make <hi>properly,</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> not onely a ſpirituall, but alſo a politike bodie or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall common-wealth: yet I ſhould and do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding denie his conſequence, for thoſe two cauſes, which Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did in his <hi>Replyes</hi> alledge, but, as you haue ſeene, not ſufficiently confute.</p>
               <p n="16">16 And truly if this argument of Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> were of force, it would in my opinion convince, that not only the temporall power among Chriſtians is ſubiect to the ſpirituall power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but alſo that the temporall power among infidell Princes is alſo ſubiect to the <hi>Popes</hi> ſpirituall authoritie, which neuertheleſſe Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth denie; for if the temporall gouernment of an infidell Prince doe hurt and hinder the ſpirituall good of Chriſtian Religion, he is bound to change that manner of gouernment euen with the hinderance of temporall good, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I might conclude with Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that it is a ſigne that the temporall power of an heathen Prince is ſubiect to the ſpirituall power of Chriſtian religion. And therefore as the changing of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gouernment among infidells, when it hindereth the ſpirituall good of Chriſtian religion, is no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne of any ſubiection <hi>per ſe</hi> of their temporall power to the <hi>Popes</hi> ſpirituall authoritie, but onely of a bond of charitie, whereby all men are by the law of God and nature bound not to hinder true ſpirituall good for a temporall commoditie, ſo alſo among Chriſtians it is no probable ſigne of any ſubiection or ſubordination of the temporall power to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, but at the moſt of a greater bond of charitie, whereby Chriſtians not only by the law of God and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20729:117"/>
nature, but alſo by the bond of Chriſtian religion, which they profeſſe, are obliged not to hinder the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good thereof for a temporall commoditie.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Now you ſhall ſee, how inſufficiently alſo <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> replyeth to thoſe two anſwers, which I made to Card. <hi>Bellarmines Replyes,</hi> wherein are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the cauſes, why I denyed the <hi>conſequence</hi> of his argument, and why a temporall Prince is bound to change the manner of his temporall gouernment, when it hindereth the ſpirituall good. And <hi>firſt</hi> to my <hi>first</hi> anſwer <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> replyeth thus:<note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 341.</note> that by my anſwer <hi>it is clearely gathered, that I ſay nothing in this place, which maketh to the ouerthrowing of</hi> Card. Bellarmines <hi>argument. For I confeſſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that a Prince of a leſſe noble common-wealth is not bound to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any detriment onely for the order of charitie, that an other common-wealth more noble doe not ſuffer the like, vnleſſe either hee bee ſubiect to the Prince of that noble common-wealth, or vnleſſe one hath both the common wealths ſubiect to him. Therefore I am conſtrained,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to confeſſe, that the principall reaſon, why a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Prince ought to ſuffer detriment in temporalls, lest that the ſpirituall good be hindered, is not the order of charitie, but the ſubiection of the temporall common wealth to the ſpirituall, when they concurre to make one Chriſtian common-wealth, or one myſticall bodie of Chriſt. Therefore I haue not,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>confuted</hi> Card: Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines <hi>argument, but haue yeelded vp the bucklers, yea and alſo haue confirmed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 But truly it is ſtrange to ſee, with what bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, men otherwiſe learned, dare aduenture to auouch ſuch groſſe and palpable vntruths, and when their anſwers are cleane ouerthrowne, to brag not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the victorie, but alſo that their <hi>Aduerſarie</hi> hath granted, and confirmed their anſwers. For obſerue, <hi>good Reader,</hi> how vntrue and fraudulent this anſwer is. I affirmed, as you haue ſeene, that the reaſon, why a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20729:118"/>
temporall Chriſtian Prince is bound to change his manner of gouernment, if it hinder the ſpirituall good, is not, for that the temporall power is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne nature ſubiect to the ſpirituall, as Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pretended, but becauſe he being a Chriſtian Prince, to whom eſpecially, more then to a Heathen, it doth belong to haue care of true ſpirituall good, which Chriſtian Religion ought chiefly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is by the order of charitie, and not for any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall ſubiection, or ſubordination of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power to the ſpirituall, bound to preferre, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the ſpirituall good before the temporall. And whereas <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> replyed, <hi>that for the order of charitie one common wealth, although the leſſe noble, is not bound to ſuffer detriment, that an other common wealth more noble do not ſuffer the like detriment; and one priuate man, who is bound to giue all his goods for the preſeruation of his owne common wealth, is not likewiſe bound to doe the like for an other common wealth although more noble; Seeing therefore that a temporall common-wealth is bound to ſuffer damage for the ſpirituall, it is a ſigne, that they are not two diuerſe common-wealths, but parts of one and the ſelfe ſame common wealth, and one ſubiect to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. To this <hi>Reply</hi> I anſwered, by ſhewing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritie betwixt one temporall common-wealth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an other, and a temporall common-wealth compared to the ſpirituall common wealth: becauſe the ſame Prince, or ſubiect of one temporall common wealth is ſeldome, or neuer, a Prince or ſubiect of the other, and therefore the order of charitie requireth, that both the Prince and ſubiect ought to prefer the temporall good of their owne common wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the temporall good of an other more noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth: As alſo a man leſſe noble ought in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to prefer, if other things be alike, his own tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good before the temporall good of an other man more noble. But if it ſhould ſo fall out, that the ſame
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20729:118"/>
man were Prince of both common wealths, or the ſame priuate man were a part and member of both common wealths, in this caſe the order of charitie would require, that he, who is member, or hath charge of both common-wealths, ſhould preferre, if other things be alike, the temporall good of the more noble common wealth before the temporal good of the leſſe noble, not by reaſon of any ſubiection of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth to the other, but becauſe both common-wealths are ſubiect to the ſame Prince, or the ſame priuate man is ſubiect to both common wealths, and therefore they ought with due reſpect and order of charitie to haue care of both, and to preferre the more worthy common wealth before the leſſe worthy.</p>
               <p n="20">20. As likewiſe if one man hath diuerſe trades, one more noble, an other leſſe noble, one more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and other leſſe profitable, if in caſe he ſhould bee compelled to looſe, or preiudice one of his trades, the order of charitie would require, that hee ſhould rather looſe, or preiudice the leſſe noble, then the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the leſſe profitable, then the more profitable trade, neither from hence could it bee gathered, that one trade were ſubiect, or ſubordained to another, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that both trades were ſubiect to one man. So likwiſe if a man were conſtrained to looſe either his eye or his finger, the order of charitie would require that hee ſhould preferre the eye before the finger, for that the eye is a more noble, a more neceſſarie, a more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table part of the body then the finger, and yet from hence we cannot well conclude, that therefore the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſubiect or ſubordained to the eye, but that both are parts and members of the body of the ſame man, who therefore by order of charitie ought with due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and reſpect to haue a care of the whole body and euery part thereof, and to preferre the more worthy, neceſſary or profitable before the leſſe worthy, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie or profitable member. And this I ſaid was the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20729:119"/>
plaine caſe of the temporall power among Chriſtians compared to the ſpirituall, for that the Eccleſiaſticall and ciuill power, temporall power and ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection &amp;c. are among Chriſtians ſo vnited in one ſubiect, that the ſame Chriſtian man is a part, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Citizen both of the temporall, and alſo of the ſpirituall common wealth, and both common wealths may be ſubiect to the ſame Prince, as appeareth in the Pope, and therefore the order of charitie doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that euery Chriſtian man ought to preferre the ſpirituall good, and ſpirituall common wealth, before the temporall good and the temporall common-wealth, not for that the temporall power, or common wealth is ſubiect to the ſpirituall, but for that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes and people are parts, members, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of both common wealths, and the ſpirituall is farre more noble, and worthy, and therefore if other things be alike, to bee preferred before the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, by them who are parts and members of them both.</p>

                  <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 343.</note> replieth in this manner. <hi>I anſwer that my Aduerſary</hi> Widdrington <hi>ſaith nothing, which doth weaken</hi> Card. Bellarmines <hi>argument. That which</hi> Card. Bellarmine <hi>did aſſume, to wit, that a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Prince is bound to change his manner of gouernment, not onely, leaſt that hee ſhould hurt in ſpirituals his owne ſubiects, but alſo leaſt that he ſhould hurt other Chriſtians, my Aduerſarie</hi> Widdrington <hi>doth grant. And in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, or antecedent propoſition all the force of</hi> Card. Bellarmines <hi>argument doth conſiſt. Beſides, when</hi> Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington <hi>denyeth, that the temporall power is</hi> per ſe <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ſpirituall, or that both of them bee parts of one, and the ſelfe ſame Chriſtian common-wealth, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards granteth, that a temporall King, and thoſe, who are

ciuilly ſubiect vnto him, are members of the myſticall body, and Citizens of the ſame ſpirituall Kingdome, he doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly contradict himſelfe. For what elſe is this, that Chriſtian Kings and their Subiects are members of the ſame myſticall body of Chriſt, and Citizens of the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Kingdome, I ſay, what elſe is this, then that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings, and their Lay-Subiects are parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian common-wealth? For the Chriſtian common-wealth, and the myſticall bodie of Chriſt, and the ſpirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt are altogether the ſame: of which common-wealth Kings with Laikes, Biſhops with Clerks are parts, as oftentimes hath beene ſayd. In which Chriſtian com-wealth, and myſticall body, and Kingdome of Chriſt all things are ſo well diſpoſed and ordered, that temporall things doe ſerue ſpirituall, and ciuill power is ſubiect to Eccleſiaſticall, which concluſion my Aduerſarie</hi> Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington <hi>hath many waies attempted to ouerthrow, but he was not able. And he was not able not onely to ouerthrow the concluſion, but alſo he hath not beene able to weaken at all with any probable anſwer the firſt argument which Card.</hi> Bellarmine <hi>brought to prooue this concluſion, which the Readers will eaſily perceiue, if without perturbation of minde they will conſider that which hath beene ſayd by vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 But this <hi>Reply</hi> of <hi>D.

The Antecedent propoſition was, <hi>that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince is bound to change the manner of his temporal
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:20729:121"/>
gouernment, if it hurt the ſpirituall good, not onely of his owne Subiects, but alſo of the Subiects of other Chriſtian Princes,</hi> and this propoſition I did willingly grant him, but the force of his argument did not conſiſt only in this <hi>antecedent propoſition,</hi> as <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> vntruly affirmeth, but in the <hi>conſequence,</hi> which hee inferred from this antecedent propoſition, or if wee will reduce his argument to a ſyllogiſticall forme, in his <hi>Minor propoſition,</hi> or <hi>aſſumption,</hi> which was this, <hi>but of this,</hi> to wit, that a Chriſtian Prince is bound to change the manner of his temporall gouernment in the caſe aforeſaid, <hi>no other reaſon can be giuen, but that both powers are members of the ſame body, and one power or body ſubiect to the other.</hi> And this <hi>conſequence, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> or <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition, wherein the whole force of his argument did conſiſt, I vtterly denyed, and I alledged, as you haue ſeene, an other plaine and perſpicuous reaſon, why a Chriſtian Prince in the caſe aforeſaid is bound to change the manner of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall gouernment, to wit, not for that temporall power is <hi>per ſe</hi> ſubiect to the ſpirituall, or for that they make one totall bodie, or common-wealth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of temporall and ſpirituall power, but for that all Chriſtians, both Princes and ſubiects, are parts and members not onely of the temporall, but alſo of the ſpiritual common-wealth, for which cauſe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince is bound to change the manner of his temporall gouernment, when it is hurtfull to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good of the Church, or ſpirituall kingdome of Chriſt, whereof he is a true part and member, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before.</p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is very vntrue, <hi>that I doe any waie contradict my ſelfe,</hi> as D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> affirmeth, <hi>firſt in denying that temporall power is</hi> per ſe <hi>ſubiect to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, or that both of them are parts of one and the ſelfe-ſame Chriſtian common-wealth or Church of Christ, and afterwards in granting, that temporall Kings, and their

affirmed, and neuer denied, to wit, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings, and their ſubiects are parts and members of the Church, and ſubiect to the ſpirituall power thereof, but the contradiction, which hee pretended to proue, he doth not proue at all, nor make any ſhew of proofe thereof, to wit, that it is all one to ſay, that Chriſtian Princes and their ſubiects are parts and members of the Church, and ſubiect to her ſpirituall power, which I alwaies granted, and that the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall power doe compound the Church, or that the temporall power it ſelfe is <hi>per ſe,</hi> ſubiect to the ſpirituall power of the Church, which I euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and out of Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne grounds haue cleerely proued the contrary, and haue plainely ſhewed, that temporall power doth only compound a temporall or ciuill body or common-wealth, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the King is head,</hi> as D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> doth heere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirme, and that the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body, and ſpirituall Kingdome, or Chriſtian common-wealth (taking the Chriſtian common-wealth for the Church onely, and not for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, as it containeth temporall and ſpirituall power) is compounded onely of ſpirituall, and not of temporall power. In which Church of Chriſt, and alſo Chriſtian world, all things are ſo well ordered and diſpoſed, that temporall things ought by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of good Chriſtians, to ſerue ſpirituall things, and temporall Princes, although in ſpiritualls they are ſubiect to the ſpirituall power of the Church, yet in temporalls, or as they haue temporall power, they are not ſubiect but ſupreame, and conſequently the temporall power it ſelfe ſpeaking <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> is not ſubiect to the ſpirituall, nor dooth compound the ſpirituall kingdome or Church of Chriſt.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>THE fourth argument,</hi> which Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> bringeth to prooue this ſubiection of of the temporall power among Chriſtians, to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power of the Church, is taken from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of S. <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene, who compareth the temporall and ſpirituall power among Chriſtians to the body and ſoule in man:</hi> yea, and alſo affirmeth, <hi>that temporall Magiſtrates are ſubiect to ſpirituall Paſtors.</hi> And this ſimilitude doth ſo greatly pleaſe Card. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> conceit, that when hee hath any fit occaſion, he ſpareth not to inculcate it, as a very ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fit ſimilitude to proue, that the temporall power among Chriſtians is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſubiect to the ſpirituall, as the body in man is <hi>per ſe,</hi> ſubiect to the ſoule. <hi>For as the ſpirit and fleſh,</hi> ſaith he<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. pont. cap. <hi>6.</hi>

For the ſpirit and fleſh are as it were two common-wealths, which may be found ſeparated, and alſo vnited. The fleſh hath ſenſe and appetite, to which are anſwerable their acts and proper obiects, and of all which the immediate end is the health &amp; good conſtitution of the body. The ſpirit hath vnderſtanding and wil, and acts and proportionate obiects, and for her end the health and perfection of the ſoule.

For the fleſh is ſubiect, the ſpirit is ſuperiour, and although the ſpirit doth not intermeddle hir ſelfe with the actions of the fleſh, but doth ſuffer the fleſh to exerciſe all hir actions, as ſhee doth exerciſe in beaſts, yet when they doe hurt the end of the ſpirit, the ſpirit doth command the fleſh, and doth puniſh hir, and if it be needfull, doth appoint faſtings, and alſo other afflictions, euen with ſome detriment, and weakning of the bodie, and doth compell the tongue not to ſpeake, the eyes not to ſee, &amp;c. In like manner if any action of the fleſh, yea and death it ſelfe, be neceſſarie to obtaine the end of the ſpirit, the ſpirit hath power to command the fleſh to expoſe hir ſelfe and all hirs, as wee ſee in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi>

               <p n="3">3 <hi>Euen ſo the ciuill power hath hir Princes, lawes, iudgements &amp;c. and likewiſe the Eccleſiaſticall hath hir Biſhops, Canons, iudgements. The ciuill hath for hir end temporall peace, the ſpirituall euerlaſting ſaluation. They are ſometimes found ſeparated, as long ſince in the time of the Apoſtles, ſometimes vnited as now. And when they are vnited, they make one bodie, and therefore they ought to be connected, and the inferiour ſubiect, and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to the ſuperiour. Therefore the ſpirituall power doth not intermeddle hir ſelfe with temporall affaires, but doth ſuffer all things to proceed, as before they were vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo that they be not hurtfull to the ſpirituall end, or not neceſſarie to the attayning therevnto.

                  <hi>is onely compounded of ſpirituall power.</hi> Seeing therefore, that the reaſon why Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> affirmeth, that temporall power among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is ſubiect to the ſpirituall, is for that they do make one totall bodie, or common-wealth, as the bodie and ſoule doe make one man, and conſequently the temporall power muſt be ſubiect to the ſpirituall, as the bodie is ſubiect to the ſoule of man, and as I haue clearely proued, there is no ſuch vnion of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall power to make one totall bodie conſiſting of both powers, which is the ſpirituall kingdome or Church of CHRIST, it is manifeſt, that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:20729:124"/>
Card <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument drawne from this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the ſoule and bodie, being grounded vpon this vnion of the temporall and ſpirituall power, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding one totall bodie, hath no ſure ground, or foundation at all.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Secondly,</hi> although I doe willingly grant, as you haue ſeene before<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.</note>, that not onely the temporall and ſpirituall power among Chriſtians, as they are referred not to their viſible heads here on earth, but to CHRIST the inviſible head of them both, doe make one totall bodie, or common-wealth, conſiſting actually of both powers, which may bee called the Chriſtian world (in which ſenſe the Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth is vſually taken, but the Church of CHRIST, and eſpecially the ſpirituall kingdome of CHRIST is ſeldome taken in that ſenſe) but alſo the whole world, conſiſting of Chriſtians, and Infidells, may in that manner be called one totall bodie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of CHRIST, at leaſt wiſe, as he is GOD, is the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and celeſtiall head, neuertheleſſe this ſimilitude of the ſoule and bodie vnited in one man doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auaile to proue the ſubiection of the temporall power to the ſpirituall, both vnited in one totall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, whereof CHRIST onely, and no earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the head. For the reaſon, why the bodie in man is ſubiect to the ſoule, is becauſe the bodie and ſoule doe make one <hi>eſſentiall</hi> compound, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers doe call it, whereof the bodie is the matter, and the ſoule is the forme, and conſequently the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die muſt of neceſſitie, and by a naturall ſequele, be ſubiect to the ſoule, as euery matter is <hi>per ſe</hi> and of it own nature ſubiect to the form, with which it maketh one <hi>eſſentiall</hi> compound, but the temporal &amp; ſpiritual power or earthly Kingdomes, and the ſpirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, as they make one totall body, wherof Chriſt onely is the head, doe not make one <hi>eſſentiall</hi> compound, whereof one is as the matter, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20729:124"/>
as the forme, but they doe make one <hi>integrall</hi> compound, as the Philoſophers doe call it, in that manner as the bodie of man is compounded of eyes, eares, tongue, hands, feete, which are called by the Philoſophers <hi>integrall,</hi> and not <hi>eſſentiall</hi> parts of mans bodie; but in an <hi>integrall</hi> compound, it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as I ſhewed before<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>nu:</hi> 10.</note>, that one part be ſubiect to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, although all muſt be ſubiect to the head, as it is apparant in the eyes, eares, tongue, hands, and feet of mans bodie, whereof none is ſubiect one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although all be ſubiect to the head. Seeing therefore that the temporall and ſpirituall power are onely <hi>integrall</hi> parts of the totall body, whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely is the head, it is euident that from hence no probable argument can be drawne to proue, that the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall, but that both of them are vnited and ſubiect to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible head of them both.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> although I ſhould alſo grant, that this were a fit ſimilitude in all things, and that the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall in that manner as the body is ſubiect to the ſoule of man, yet this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſubiection would nothing auaile to proue, that the ſpirituall power could either directly, or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſe of temporalls, depriue temporall Princes of their temporall liues or dominions, vſe temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, or exerciſe any temporall action, but it is rather a very fit ſimilitude to conuince the flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For as I will eaſily grant, that the ſoule hath power to command, or forbid the body to exerciſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corporall action, when it is neceſſarie or hurtfull to the end not onely of the ſoule but alſo of the body, (which laſt clauſe Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cunningly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, for that it fauoureth, as you ſhall ſee, the Popes direct power to command temporalls) as to ſee, to heare, to ſpeake, and ſuch like actions, which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the command of mans will, I ſay, <hi>which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:20729:125"/>
to the command of mans will,</hi> for that there be many corporall actions, which are not in the power of mans will to command, as are all the actions of the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, vegetatiue and generatiue powers; But if the body by any let, or hinderance can not, or (if it were poſſible) would not doe that corporall action, which the ſoule would willingly haue the body to doe, as to ſee, to heare, to ſpeake, or to goe, the ſoule hath no power of her ſelfe either directly, or indirectly, that is, either for the good of the body, or for the good of the ſoule, to do that corporall action, as to ſee, heare, ſpeake, or goe, without the concurrence of the body it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Neither hath the ſoule any power to inflict any corporal puniſhment by way of <hi>coercion</hi> or conſtraint, that is, to puniſh actually with corporall puniſhment any member of the body without the concurrence of ſome one or other member thereof, but onely by the way of <hi>command,</hi> that is, to command ſome one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to puniſh it ſelfe; or an other member, as the hands, feete, or head, to put themſelues into fire or water, or the hands, to whip the ſhoulders, to cloſe thy eye-lids, to ſtop the eares, not to put meate into the mouth, and ſuch like, which if the bodily member by any let, or hinderance can not, or, <hi>if it were poſſible,</hi> would not doe, the ſoule hath done all that is in her power to doe, for that ſhe cannot of her ſelfe doe any corporall action, without the concurrence of ſome corporall member, but the moſt that ſhe can doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any corporall action or puniſhment, is to command the body to concurre with her to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that corporall action, or puniſhment. I ſaid <hi>[if it were poſſible]</hi> for that there is ſuch a naturall, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, and intrinſecall ſubiection of the body to the ſoule, that the body cannot reſiſt the effectuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſoule in thoſe things which are ſubiect to her command, and therefore I ſaid, that <hi>if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:20729:125"/>
that the body could reſiſt the command of the ſoule, yet the ſoule of her ſelfe hath not power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any corporall action without the concurrance of a corporall organ; which manner of ſubiection is not betweene the temporall and ſpirituall power, for that this ſubiection being in diuerſe perſons hauing free will, is free and voluntarie, and therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand may be reſiſted, but the former being of the body to the ſoule, making one only perſon, who hath free will, is neceſſarie and naturall, and therefore can not be reſiſted.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In the like manner I will eaſily grant, that the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall, or rather that temporall Princes, who haue temporall power, but not as they haue temporall power, are ſubiect to ſpirituall Paſtours, who haue ſpirituall power, in ſuch ſort, that the ſpirituall Paſtour hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the temporall Prince to do thoſe temporal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to his temporall power, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to the end of the ſpirituall power, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him thoſe actions belonging to his temporall power, which are repugnant to the end of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power, which is eternall ſaluation, which if hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to doe, and will not obey the command of the ſpirituall Paſtour, the ſpirituall Paſtour can not by vertue only of his ſpirituall power exerciſe any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; or ciuill action, belonging to the temporall, or ciuill power, without the conſent, or concurrance of the temporall power: Neither can the ſpirituall Paſtor inflict any temporall, or ciuill puniſhment by way of <hi>coercion,</hi> conſtraint, or compulſion, that is, puniſh actually with any temporall, or ciuill puniſhment without the conſent, &amp; concurrance of the temporall, or ciuill power, but only by the way of <hi>command,</hi> that is, he hath power to command the temporall Prince, who only hath ſupreme temporall authoritie, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelfe, or his ſubiects with temporall, or ciuill
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:20729:126"/>
puniſhments, if they vſe their temporals to the hurt? and preiudice of the ſpirituall power, or the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? although I doe willingly grant, that the ſpirituall Paſtour hath power to puniſh the temporall Prince, or his ſubiects, with ſpirituall puniſhments, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the way of <hi>command,</hi> but alſo of <hi>coercion</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint that is, to puniſh them actually, whether they will or no, with ſpirituall puniſhments, when they ſhall refuſe to obey his iuſt command, for that this manner of puniſhing by way of <hi>coercion</hi> doth not exceede the limits of the ſpirituall <hi>coerciue</hi> power.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now if my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> demand or mee, why the ſpirituall power may of her ſelfe command tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall actions, and yet neither <hi>directly,</hi> nor <hi>indirectly,</hi> that is, neither for temporall, nor ſpirituall good, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe temporall actions, may command ciuill puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they are neceſſarie to the end of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power, and yet neither <hi>directly,</hi> nor indirectly puniſh actually with ciuill puniſhments without the concurrance of the ſpirituall power, I anſwer them by their owne ſimilitude, which pleaſeth them ſo much; for the ſame reaſon, that the ſoule hath power of her ſelfe to command bodily actions, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>directly,</hi> nor indirectly, that is, neither for the good of the body, nor of the ſoule, to doe of her ſelfe alone any bodily action, hath power to command bodily puniſhments, and yet of her ſelfe hath not power to inflict any bodily puniſhment, without the concurrance of the bodie it ſelfe. And thus you ſee, that this ſimilitude, of which Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and his followers doe make ſo great account, is no fit ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude to prooue their doctrine, but rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme ours, and that from this ſimilitude no probable argument can be drawen to prooue, that the ſpirituall Paſtour hath power either <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of temporals, to depoſe temporall Princes, or to puniſh temporally by way of <hi>coercion</hi> or conſtraint.</p>

                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:20729:126"/>11. But <hi>fourthly,</hi> although the temporall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power were aptly compared by Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> to the bodie and ſoule, yet it would prooue two things more then he, as I ſuppoſe, would willingly admit; The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that: the temporall power can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe no temporall action without the concurrance and aſſiſtance of the ſpirituall power, as the body can doe no corporall action, vnleſſe the ſoule alſo, as an efficient cauſe thereof, doe concurre thereunto; For this is a cleere and approoued principle in philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, that the ſoule is cauſe of all motions in the body, according to that common definition or deſcription of the ſoule aſſigned by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> De Anima tex. <hi>24.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that the ſpirituall power may command or forbid the ciuill power to exerciſe ciuill actions, not onely when they are neceſſarie, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the end of the ſpirituall power, which is the health of the ſoule, but alſo when they are neceſſarie or hurtfull to the end of the temporall power, which is temporall peace, as the ſoule hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or forbid the bodie to exerciſe bodily actions, as to ſee, heare, ſpeake &amp;c. not onely when they are neceſſary, or hurtfull to the end, and good of the ſoule, which is ſpirituall life and health, but alſo when they are neceſſarie or hurtfull to the good of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is bodily health and life. And therefore Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> declaring this ſimilitude of the ſpirit and fleſh doth only affirme, that the ſpirit doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the fleſh, when her actions are hurtfull to the end of the ſpirit, but cunningly omitteth, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alſo dorh command the fleſh, when her actions are neceſſarie, or hurtfull to the end of the fleſh, leaſt the <hi>Reader</hi> ſhould preſently perceiue therby the diſparity of this ſimilitude, or elſe from thence inferre, that in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:20729:127"/>
the ſame manner the ſpirituall power may command the temporall power not onely in order to ſpirituall good, but alſo in order to temporall good, which is the Canoniſt, doctrine, and which <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> doth at large impugne.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> in what manner S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> did compare the temporall and ſpirituall power, or rather temporall and ſpirituall Princes to the bodie and ſoule, I haue ſufficiently declared before<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.</note> to wit, not in the manner of their vnion or ſubiection, but onely in nobility, and in that temporall Princes are in as excellent and worthy manner ſubiect to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes, as ſpirituall things are more excellent and worthy then temporall. So that neither from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>S. Gregorie Nazianzene,</hi> nor from the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude it ſelfe of the bodie and ſoule, as it is declared and vrged by Card, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> can it with any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie be gathered, that the ſpirituall power can of her ſelfe exerciſe any temporall action belonging to the ciuill power, without the concurrance of the ciuill power, although it be neceſſarie to the end of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power, as the ſoule cannot of her ſelfe without the concurrance of the bodie exerciſe any bodily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, although it be neceſſarie to the end, not onely of the body, but alſo of the ſoule. And therefore I maruell, that Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could bee ſo much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeene, as to vrge and repeat ſo often this ſimilitude of the ſoule and body to prooue the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe, and to diſpoſe of all temporals, which is ſo flat againſt him, and which, if it were a fit ſimilitude, doth rather confirme the doctrine of the Canoniſts, whom Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> taketh vpon him to confute, then his owne opinon. But the truth is, that it confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neither, for that, as I declared before,<note n="i" place="margin">

Therefore both the ſpirituall, and the materiall ſword doe belong to the Church, but the materiall is indeed to bee exerciſed, or drawne forth for the Church; but the ſpirituall alſo by the Church: the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall with the hand of the Prieſt, the materiall with the hand of the Souldier, but indeed at the booke,</hi> or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>of the Prieſt, and at the command of the Emperour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The pricipall words of <hi>Pope Boniface,</hi> beſides thoſe which hee doth imitate out of <hi>S Bernard</hi> are, <hi>That in the Catholicke, and Apoſtolike Church, whereof
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:20729:128"/>
Chriſt is the head, and S.</hi> Peter <hi>his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar, and in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there be two ſwords, the ſpirituall, and the temporall, as we are inſtructed by thoſe words of the Goſpell,</hi> Behold heere; <hi>that is in the Church,</hi> two ſwords, <hi>&amp;c. And that the ſword muſt be vnder the ſword, the temporall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ſubiect to the ſpirituall power. For the ſpirituall, the truth ſo witneſſing, hath to inſtruct the earthly power, and to iudge if it be not good. So of the Church, and of the Eccleſiaſtical power, the propheſie of Ieremy is verified,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I haue appointed thee this day ouer nations and Kingdomes, <hi>and the reſt which follow. Therefore if the earthly power goeth out of the way, ſhee ſhall be iudged by the ſpirituall power, but if the inferiour ſpirituall power goeth out of the way, ſhee ſhall be iudged by her ſuperiour, but if the ſupreme goeth out of the way, ſhee can be iudged by God alone, and not by man, according to the teſtimony of the</hi> Apoſtle, That the ſpiritual man iudgeth all things, and he is iudged by none.

ſword, when the neceſſitie of the Church ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it: ſeeing that the queſtion betweene mee and Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is not concerning the <hi>Popes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> power, and whether the <hi>Pope</hi> may <hi>command</hi> a <hi>King</hi> to vſe the temporal ſword in the neceſſitie of the Church, as I haue oftentimes in all my Bookes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirmed, but concerning the <hi>Popes coerciue</hi> power, and whether if a King will not vſe the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſword at the <hi>Popes command,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to vſe it himſelfe, and may conſtraine a King not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſpirituall, but alſo with temporal compulſion, and puniſhment to fulfill his iuſt command; Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, becauſe Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath now in his <hi>Schulckenius,</hi> taken ſome exceptions againſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, which I made in my <hi>Apologie</hi> to the authortie of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>Pope Boniface,</hi> who, as hee ſaith, doth imitate S. <hi>Bernards</hi> words, I thinke it not amiſſe to ſet downe my <hi>anſwere,</hi> and alſo his <hi>Reply,</hi> that ſo the <hi>Reader</hi> may cleerely perceiue, whether S. <hi>Bernard</hi> doth fauour, or diſfauour Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> power to vſe the temporall ſword, in caſe a temporall <hi>King</hi> will not vſe it at the <hi>Popes command,</hi> and whether D. <hi>Schul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckenius</hi> hath ſufficiently confuted the <hi>anſwere,</hi> which I did make to the aforeſaid authoritie of <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Thus therefore I anſwered in my <hi>Apologie</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Nu. <hi>196.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note>, <q>that the words of <hi>S.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20729:129"/>
of their holy mother the Church, to vſe the temporall ſword. Wherfore although the Church, when ſhe hath preſent need, hath power to <hi>command,</hi> or forbid the vſe of the materiall ſword, or rather without any poſitiue, or conſtitutiue <hi>command</hi> of the Church Secular Princes are bound in that caſe to vſe it, yet it doth not therefore follow, that the Church hir ſelfe hath dominion, right, or power to vſe the corporall ſword, ſeeing that to <hi>command</hi> the vſe thereof, and to vſe it hir ſelfe are farre different things, as I haue ſhewed before<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 99.</note> yea and the very words of <hi>S. Bernard</hi> doe plainly ſhew as much. For otherwiſe if the Church, that is, as ſhee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of Eccleſiaſticall power, ſhould haue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the materiall ſword, and might vſe it in order to ſpirituall good, it might by the law of God be drawne forth and vſed, not only for the Church but alſo by the Church, not onely with the hand of the ſouldier, but alſo of the Prieſt, which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe <hi>S.

                  <q>6 Therefore the temporall ſword according to the opinion of <hi>S. Bernard</hi> doth belong to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and is called <hi>his ſword,</hi> for that, when the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the Church doth require, it is to bee drawne forth <hi>for the Church, but not by the Church, with the hand of the ſouldier, but not of the Priest, at the becke indeede,</hi> or direction, <hi>of the Priest, but at the command of the Emperour.</hi> By which laſt words <hi>S. Bernard</hi> doth ſignifie, that the Emperour in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the temporall ſword for the neceſſitie of the Church is indeed to bee directed by the <hi>Pope</hi> (for that the <hi>Pope</hi> ought to declare, when the Church hath neceſſitie, but the vſe it ſelfe of the ſword doth immediately depend vpon the <hi>Emperors command,</hi> to whoſe <hi>command</hi> the ſouldiers in vſing the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſword are immediately ſubiect.</q>

                  <q>7 But what if the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſhall refuſe to vſe the temporall ſword at the <hi>Popes becke,</hi> or direction? Hath therefore the <hi>Pope,</hi> according to <hi>S.

Wherefore theſe words of <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p n="9">9 Marke now, <hi>good Reader,</hi> the cunning, not to ſay, fraudulent proceeding of this man. Hitherto he hath, as you haue ſeene, taken the Church, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian common-wealth, the myſticall bodie, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kingdom of Chriſt to be all one, and to be one totall bodie, conſiſting both of temporall, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power, and compareth hir to a man compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of bodie and ſoule; And may it not, I pray you, be rightly ſaid, that all the powers both of bodie and ſoule are ſubiect to man? and why then may it not alſo be rightly ſaid, that the ſpirituall ſword or power is ſubiect to the Church? But now <hi>forſooth</hi> this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, that hee might take an occaſion to charge me with a manifeſt falſhood, will not take the Church, as hee tooke it before for the whole myſticall bodie of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which totall bodie includeth both the <hi>Pope,</hi> and all other inferiour members thereof, in which ſenſe I did take the <hi>Church,</hi> when I affirmed, <hi>that not onely the ſpirituall, but alſo the temporall ſword is in ſome ſort ſubiect to the Church,</hi> but hee will take the <hi>Church</hi> for one part onely of this myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, to wit, for all the members of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Pope,</hi> in which ſenſe the <hi>Church</hi> is indeed ſometimes taken, as when the <hi>Church</hi> is compared with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and it is ſaid, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is head of the <hi>Church;</hi> but when the <hi>Church</hi> is compared with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and is ſaid to be the myſticall bodie and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kingdome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> doth include

both the <hi>Pope,</hi> and all other inferiour members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who iointly make one totall bodie, whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the head. And the very like is ſeene in the bodie of man; for when the bodie is compared with the head, the bodie doth not include the head, but when the bodie is compared with the ſoule, &amp; ſaid to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ſoule, &amp; that of the bodie &amp; ſoule is made one man, then the bodie doth alſo include the head.</p>

And would not D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> thinke, that I did cauill, if I ſhould ſay of him, as hee ſaith of mee, that he ſpake not rightly, when in this very place hee affirmeth, <hi>that Chriſt gaue to the Church both the ſwords.

               <p n="11">11.

the power, which the Pope hath, alſo to the <hi>Church,</hi> and that the <hi>Popes</hi> power is ſubiect to the <hi>Church,</hi> and that it doth not therefore follow, that the Paſtour is ſubiect to the ſheepe, or the ſuperiour to the inferiour, but rather contrariwiſe. But in very truth this was not my meaning, when I affirmed, that both ſwords are in ſome ſort ſubiect to the <hi>Church,</hi> for by the name of <hi>Church</hi> I vnderſtood alſo the <hi>Pope,</hi> as I declared before</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Secondly, when</hi> Widdrington <hi>affirmeth,</hi> ſaith D. <hi>Schulckenius, that the ciuill power is not</hi> per ſe <hi>ſubiect to the Eccleſiaſticall, he doth corrupt the text of</hi> S. Bernard, <hi>and of Pope</hi> Boniface <hi>the eight. For when</hi> S. Bernard <hi>ſaith, that the materiall ſword is the</hi> Popes, <hi>and is to bee drawne forth at his becke,</hi> and direction, <hi>he clearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that the materiall ſword is ſubiect to the ſpirituall ſword, which Pope</hi> Boniface <hi>doth declare more</hi> plainely, <hi>when he ſaith, that the ſword muſt be vnder the ſword, and temporall authoritie ſubiect to ſpirituall power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. But how ſhamefully <hi>D.

For S. <hi>Bernard</hi> doth ſay, <hi>that the materiall ſword is the</hi> Popes, <hi>and doth belong to the</hi> Pope, but with this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>in ſome ſort, to bee drawne foorth for the Church, but not by the Church, with the hand of the Souldier, not of the Prieſt, at the becke,</hi> or direction, <hi>of the Prieſt, but at the command of the Emperour:</hi> and I alſo ſay the very ſame. But <hi>S. Bernard</hi> doth not ſay, that the materiall ſword is ſubiect to the ſpirituall ſword <hi>per ſe,</hi> but only <hi>in ſome ſort, to be drawne forth for the Church, not by the Church</hi> &amp;c. From which words it is plainely gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the materiall ſword, or temporall power is, according to S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſubiect to the ſpirituall, not <hi>per ſe,</hi> but <hi>per accidons,</hi> in ſpiritualls, not in temporalls, to be commanded in ſome caſe by the Prieſt, as he is a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:20729:131"/>
Prieſt, but not to be drawne forth, or vſed by a Prieſt as he is a Prieſt, but as he is a temporall Prince, or a publike, or priuate ſouldier. In like manner I ſay with Pope <hi>Boniface, that the ſword is vnder the ſword, and the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall,</hi> but Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> doth not ſay, that the ſword is <hi>per ſe</hi> vnder the ſword, and the temporall power is <hi>per ſe</hi> ſubiect to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall authoritie, and therefore, ſeeing that hee doth imitate S. <hi>Bernards</hi> words, as Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here affirmeth, he is to be vnderſtood in that ſenſe, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> vnderſtood them, to wit, that the ſword is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſword, in <hi>ſome ſort,</hi> and the temporall power ſubiect to the ſpirituall in <hi>ſome ſort, to be drawne foorth, or vſed for the Church, but not by the Church</hi> &amp;c. as I now declared.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Thirdly, when</hi> Widdrington, <hi>affirmeth,</hi> ſaith <hi>D. Schulckenius, that the Church hath not by the law of God power to vſe the materiall ſword euen in order to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, he ſpeaketh too ambiguouſly. For the law of God doth not command Eccleſiaſticall men to vſe with their own hand the materiall ſword, neither doth it ſo forbid them, but that his lawfull for them in ſome caſes to vſe it alſo with their owne hand: But neuertheleſſe according to</hi> S. Bernards <hi>opinion</hi> Chriſt <hi>gaue both the ſwordes to the</hi> Church, <hi>and by this he gaue her power to vſe the materiall ſword in that manner, as doth beſeem her, to wit, by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, or hands of others, in directing Secular Princes, that they draw it forth, or put it in the ſcabard, as it is expedient to the honour of God, and the ſaluation of Chriſtian people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. But my words are very plaine, and no whit ambiguous I ſay, that the <hi>Church,</hi> taking the <hi>Church,</hi> not <hi>materially,</hi> for all the members of the <hi>Church,</hi> but for Churchmen, <hi>formally</hi> as they are <hi>Churchmen,</hi> or which is all one, for the <hi>Church,</hi> as it conſiſteth of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power, are according to S. <hi>Bernards</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine commanded not to draw forth, or vſe with their owne hands the materiall ſword euen in order to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20729:132"/>
good. For S. <hi>Bernards</hi> words are plaine, <hi>why doſt thou againe attempt to vſe the ſword, which thou waſt once,</hi> not only counſelled, but <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to put vp into the ſcabard</hi> &amp;c. But if the <hi>Pope</hi> becom a temporall Prince or a Prieſt do lawfully becom a Soldier, to fight either in his own defence, or in the defence of others, which Chriſt did not forbid, although the Church in ſome caſes hath forbidden it, neither I, nor S. <hi>Bernard</hi> doe denie, that the Pope, as he is a temporall Prince, or a Prieſt, as he is a lawfull Souldier, hath power to vſe with their owne hands the materiall ſword. Neither did S. <hi>Bernard</hi> euer grant, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he is <hi>Pope,</hi> or a Prieſt as he is a Prieſt, or, which is all one, by his ſpirituall, or Prieſtly authority, hath power to draw foorth, or to vſe with his owne hands the materiall ſword, although the <hi>Pope</hi> by his ſpirituall power may direct and command a temporall Prince to draw it foorth, and vſe it, when the neceſſitie of the Church ſhall require, which onely D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph doth affirme.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Fourthly, that is falſe,</hi> ſaith D. <hi>Schulckenius,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 387.</note> 
                  <hi>which</hi> Widdrington <hi>affirmeth, that the materiall ſword in that onely ſenſe doth belong to the Church, becauſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes being children of the Church are bound to fight in defence of the Church their mother. For S.</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>doth grant much more to the Eccleſiaſticall Prince, when he ſaith,</hi> Therefore it is alſo thine, <hi>to wit, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall ſword. And beneath,</hi> Therefore both the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and the materiall ſword are the Churches, but the materiall ſword is to bee drawen foorth for the Church, and the ſpirituall alſo by the Church, the ſpirituall with the hand of the Prieſt, the materiall with the hand of the Souldier, but truly at the becke, <hi>or direction</hi> of the Prieſt, and at the command of the Emperour. <hi>Where S.</hi> Bernard <hi>doth not only ſignifie, that Souldiers or Princes are bound to draw foorth the ſword for the Church, but alſo at the becke,</hi> or direction <hi>of the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:20729:132"/>
Prieſt, that is, with ſubordination to the Eccleſiaſticall power, as Souldiers ought to vſe the ſword with ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the command of the Emperour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. But anie man who readeth ouer but ſleightly my anſwer in that place, will eaſily perceiue, that this is a meere cauill, and alſo a plaine vntruth; for that in expreſſe words I doe affirme, <hi>that Secular Princes and Souldiers are, according</hi> to S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> to draw foorth, and vſe the materiall ſword for the neceſſity of the Church, at the becke, counſell, direction, yea, and command of the Prieſt, which is as much, as D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> heere affirmeth S. <hi>Bernard</hi> to ſay; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though S. <hi>Bernard</hi> did expreſſely diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>becke</hi> and <hi>command,</hi> at the <hi>becke,</hi> ſaith he, of the Prieſt, but at the <hi>command</hi> of the Emperour; whereby it is manifeſt, that S. <hi>Bernard</hi> did not account <hi>becke</hi> and <hi>command</hi> to be all one, and conſequently, hee did not approoue the ſame ſubordination to be betwixt <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> in vſing the materiall ſword, as is betwixt <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and the <hi>Emperour.</hi> For albeit S. <hi>Bernard</hi> by the name of <hi>becke</hi> did not onely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand aduiſe and counſell, which Chriſtian Princes in all their weightie affaires concerning the Law of God and Chriſtian Religion ought to demand of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prieſts, and who are skilfull in the Law of God, and Chriſtian Religion, but alſo a <hi>command</hi> to fight, and vſe the materiall ſword in defence of the Church and Chriſtian Religion, &amp; to the obſeruing of which command, Chriſtian Princes may, as alſo I ſayd, by Eccleſiaſticall cenſures bee compelled, yet this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> being a declaratiue <hi>command,</hi> which doth onely declare a former <hi>command</hi> of God, and nature, and doth not make a new bond, but onely <hi>declare</hi> and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a former obligation, may rather be called a <hi>becke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and ſignifying, that Chriſtian Princes are by the Law of God bound in that caſe to draw foorth, fight, and vſe the materiall ſword, then a true, proper, and

                     <hi>Num.</hi> 8.</note> doth vnderſtand thoſe words of <hi>S.

                  <hi>an authority to command, and an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to beckon; in the authority to command it doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> he doth that thing by whoſe authority it is done, <hi>but in the authority to beckon this doth not follow. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to command wicked men to be ſlaine is in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but the authoritie to beckon is in the Pope and Prieſts. And this beckoning as hath beene ſayd, is a preaching of the Law of God, and an exhorting, that Princes will obey the Law of God, Wherupon S.</hi> Bernard <hi>ſheweth how both the materiall and ſpirituall ſword are the Churches, and doe belong to the Church, not for as much as concerneth vſe or command, but for as much as concerneth beckoning: whereupon he ſpeaketh in this manner to</hi> Eugenius, hee that denieth the materiall ſword to be thine, ſeemeth to me not to regard ſufficiently the word of our Lord ſaying, <hi>Returne thy ſword into thy ſcabard,</hi> and ſo foorth as it followeth in <hi>S. Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. Wherefore, according to <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall ſword is ſubiect to the ſpirituall, not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in <hi>ſome ſort</hi> to be <hi>beckoned,</hi> but not to bee vſed or commanded, as <hi>beckoning</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>command,</hi> by the Prieſt, as he is a Prieſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Gloſſe,</hi> which D. Schulckenius maketh of thoſe words <hi>[at the becke indeede of the Prieſt] that is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with ſubordination to the Eccleſiaſticall power, as Souldiers ought to vſe the ſword with ſubordination to the command of the Emperor,</hi> is verie vntrue, &amp; expreſly againſt S. <hi>Bernards</hi> words; both becauſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hath power to command the ſouldier to vſe the materiall ſword, but the Prieſt according to <hi>S. Bernard</hi> hath onely power to <hi>beckon,</hi> but not to <hi>command</hi> the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20729:133"/>
vſe thereof, and alſo becauſe if the Souldier will not vſe the materiall ſword at the Emperours command; the Emperour, as Emperour, may vſe it himſelfe, and with his owne hand, which the Prieſt, as Prieſt, or, which is all one, the Eccleſiaſticall power, according to <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> cannot doe; and moreouer becauſe the Emperour, as Emperour, may compell the ſouldier with temporall puniſhments to vſe the materiall ſword, and not onely depriue him of his power and right to vſe the ſame; but alſo of his temporall life, which the Prieſt, as Prieſt, or the Eccleſiaſtical power, cannot doe.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And therefore who would not maruaile to ſee D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> ſo boldly, and in ſuch publike writings to affirme, <hi>That the queſtion is not, whether the ſpirituall Prince hath dominion, right, or power to vſe the materiall ſword: but onely, whether the ſword be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſword, and whether the temporall power bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ſpirituall. And whereas</hi> Widdrington, ſaith he, <hi>in this place confeſſeth, that the Church hath power to command, or forbid in time of neceſſitie the vſe of the materiall ſword, from thence we doe gather that the ſword is vnder the ſword, and the temporall power is ſubiect to the command, and prohibition of the ſpirituall power, which onely</hi> Card. Bellarmine <hi>in that his ſecond argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did intend. Wherefore</hi> Widdrington <hi>doth ſeeme to decline of ſet purpoſe the principall queſtion. For, as wee haue often ſaid, the queſtion is not concerning the dominion, or vſe of the materiall ſword, but concerning the power to direct it, and concerning the ſubiection of the materiall ſword to the ſpirituall. But theſe in the option of S.</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>are moſt manifeſt. And for as much as appertaineth to the vſe of the materiall ſword, wee aſſent altogether to S.</hi> Bernard, <hi>that it doth not beſeeme Eccleſiaſticall men to vſe the materiall ſword, but onely the ſpirituall, and thus much onely thoſe words of our Sauiour doe ſignifie,</hi> Put vp thy ſword into thy ſcabbard, <hi>and thoſe of S.</hi> Bernard,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:20729:134"/>
Why doeſt thou againe attempt to vſe the ſword, which once thou waſt commanded to put into the ſcabbard? <hi>For heere it is not meant of the Law of God, by which Eccleſiaſticall men are abſolutely forbidden to vſe the materiall ſword; ſeeing that it is manifeſt, that in ſome caſes, and eſpecially in defence of themſelues, and of their Countrey: this is lawfull, but of the command of God, by which Cleargie men are inſtructed, and taught, that their vocation is not to fight with the materiall, but with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſword.</hi> Thus D. <hi>Schulckenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. But it is ſtrange to ſee, how farre affection will carry the pens of learned men; In very truth I ſhould neuer haue imagined, that D. <hi>Schulckenius,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned man, who hath read my <hi>Apologie,</hi> would euer haue beene ſo bold, as to affirme, <hi>That the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt me, and</hi> Card. Bellarmine <hi>is not, whether the Pope hath power to vſe the materiall ſword, but onely whether the ſword be vnder the ſword, and the temporall power ſubiect to the command, and prohibition of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirituall power, and that this only was intended by Card.</hi> Bellarmine <hi>in his ſecond argument.</hi> For firſt concerning the queſtion betwixt mee, and Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> it is euident, that I haue oftentimes declared in my <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> and D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> alſo ſetteth downe my words, that the true ſtate of the queſtion betwixt mee and Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is not concerning the Popes power to <hi>command,</hi> but to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of temporalls, nor whether the ſword be in <hi>any manner</hi> whatſoeuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſword, or the temporal power <hi>in any ſort</hi> ſubiect to the ſpirituall, but <hi>in what manner</hi> the ſword is vnder the ſword, and <hi>after what ſort</hi> the temporall power is ſubiect to the ſpirituall. For I haue often granted, that the ſpirituall power, or the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> may <hi>command</hi> temporalls, and the vſe of the materiall ſword, and puniſh diſobedient Princes with Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cenſures: but what, which I vtterly denied, was, that the ſpirituall power, or the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope</hi> may <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:20729:134"/>
of temporalls, <hi>vſe</hi> the materiall ſword, or <hi>puniſh</hi> diſobedient Princes by taking away their liues, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, or goods.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is alſo manifeſt, that Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in his ſecond argument did not onely intend to proue, that the temporal power is ſubiect to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and prohibition of the ſpirituall power, as D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> affirmeth, but alſo, that the ſpirituall power may <hi>vſe,</hi> and diſpoſe of temporalls, depoſe temporal Princes, and inſtitute others, and conſtraine or puniſh with temporall puniſhments. For marke, I pray you, his ſecond argument: In the firſt part thereof he argueth thus. <hi>The power to vſe and diſpoſe of temporalls</hi> (and conſequently of the materiall ſword which is a temporall thing) <hi>is neceſſary to the ſpirituall end, becauſe otherwiſe wicked Princes might without puniſhment fauour Heretickes, and overthrow Religion, therefore the Church hath alſo, this power.</hi> And yet D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> doth not bluſh to affirme, that Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his ſecond argument did onely intend to proue, that the temporall power is ſubiect to the command, and prohibition of the ſpirituall power. And in the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of his argument hee concludeth thus: <hi>Therefore much more the ſpirituall common-wealth, hath power to command the temporall common-wealth, which is ſubiect vnto her, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine her to change her gouernment, and to depoſe Princes, and to inſtitute others, when ſhe can not otherwiſe defend her ſpirituall good. And in this manner are to bee vnderſtood the words of</hi> S. Bernard, <hi>and</hi> Pope Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus Card. <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> So that according to Card. <hi>Bellarmine, S. Bernards</hi> words doe proue, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power not onely to <hi>command</hi> the materiall ſword, but alſo to vſe it, vnleſſe the <hi>materiall</hi> ſword is not to be comprehended vnder the name of <hi>temporalls.</hi> And therefore not I, but D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> doth of ſet purpoſe decline the difficultie, and alſo
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20729:135"/>
vntruly affirmeth, that Card: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to proue in his ſecond argument, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to vſe the materiall ſword, but onely that the materiall ſword is ſubiect to the command and prohibition of the ſpirituall power, ſeeing that Card: <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſecond argument doth moſt clearely ſhew the contrarie.</p>
               <p n="23">23 But marke now how clearely <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> doth either contradict <hi>S. Bernards</hi> words and him ſelfe, or elſe fowly equiuocate, and confirme the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which I gaue to the authoritie of <hi>S. Bernard.</hi> I affirmed, that <hi>S. Bernards</hi> words are ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that it is lawfull for Eccleſiaſticall men, as they are Eccleſiaſticall men, to command in ſome caſes the vſe of the materiall ſword, but that to vſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall ſword themſelues, as they are Eccleſiaſticall men, they are forbidden by the expreſſe command of Chriſt. Now <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> affirmeth<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 390.</note>, <hi>that for as much at appertaineth to the vſe of the materiall ſword, he aſſenteth altogether to S. Bernard, that it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme Eccleſiasticall men to vſe the materiall ſword, but onely the ſpirituall; and thus much onely thoſe words of our Sauiour doe ſignifie,</hi> Returne thy ſword into the ſcabbard; <hi>and thoſe of S. Bernard,</hi> why doſt thou againe attempt to vſe the ſword, which once thou waſt commanded to put into the ſcabard? <hi>For here it is not meant of the law of God, by which Eccleſiasticall men are abſolutely forbidden to vſe the materiall ſword, ſeeing that it is manifeſt, that in ſome caſes, and eſpecially in defence of themſelues and of their countrey, this is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but of the command of God, by which Cleargie men are inſtructed, and taught, that their vocation is not to fight with the materiall, but with the ſpirituall ſword.</hi> Thus <hi>D. Schulckenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 But if <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> meane that Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call men are onely for decencie, which implyeth no command, not to vſe the materiall ſword, he plainly
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:20729:135"/>
contradicteth <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> to whom neuertheleſſe hee affirmeth altogether to aſſent, who expreſſely auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>S. Peter</hi> was not only <hi>counſailed,</hi> but <hi>commanded</hi> not to vſe the materiall ſword. And therefore <hi>S. Bernards</hi> words can not otherwiſe be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but that Eccleſiaſticall men, as they are Eccleſiaſticall men, and the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> are by the <hi>command</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> abſolutely forbidden to vſe the materiall ſword; for <hi>S. Bernard</hi> did not intend to affirme, that Eccleſiaſticall men, if they become temporall Princes, or being conſidered, as they are priuate men, or citizens, and parts, or members of the temporall common-wealth, are by the <hi>command</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> forbidden to vſe the materiall ſword, and to fight in defence of their owne perſons, or of their Countrey.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Wherefore thoſe laſt words of <hi>D. Schulckenius,</hi> to wit, <hi>that S. Bernards ſaying is to be vnderſtood of the command of God, by which Cleargie men are inſtructed, and taught, that their vocation is not to fight with the materiall, but with the ſpirituall ſword, are ſomewhat equivocall.</hi> For if <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> doe onely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of ſuch an inſtruction, which implyeth no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, but onely a certaine decencie, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and aduiſe, for that it doth not beſeeme the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of thoſe men, who haue a ſpirituall vocation, to fight with the materiall ſword, hee plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth himſelfe, and alſo <hi>S. Bernard</hi> himſelfe, for that hee acknowledgeth <hi>a command of God, whereby Cleargie men are inſtructed</hi> &amp;c. but this inſtruction ſuppoſeth no command of God; <hi>S. Bernard</hi> alſo he contradicteth, who expreſſely ſpeaketh of a <hi>command,</hi> whereby Eccleſiaſticall men are by the law of Chriſt, and not only of the Church forbidden to vſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall ſword, which <hi>command</hi> of Chriſt, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, can bee no other, then that Eccleſiaſticall men can not, as they are Eccleſiaſticall men, vſe the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:20729:136"/>
ſword; for that although the Eccleſiaſticall power doth according to <hi>S. Bernard</hi> and the truth, extend to the <hi>beckoning,</hi> or declaratiue commanding of the materiall ſword in ſome caſes, yet it doth not extend to the vſing thereof, but this power to vſe the materiall ſword doth proceed from the law of nature, or the ciuill power, who doe giue authoritie to euery man, whether he be a Clerke, or Laike in caſe at leaſt wiſe of neceſſitie, to vſe the materiall ſword in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his owne perſon, or of his countrey. And if <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> only intend to ſignifie thus much by thoſe laſt words of his, which in very deede can not be otherwiſe vnderſtood, vnleſſe wee will make them repugnant to themſelues, hee doth fauour, not contradict, confirme and not impugne my anſwer.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>Fiftly,</hi> obſerue, <hi>good Reader,</hi> how cunningly <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> would ſhift off the laſt, and principall <hi>Anſwer,</hi> which I made to the authoritie of <hi>S. Bernard.</hi> I granted, as you haue ſeene before, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> hath, according to <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> power to <hi>beckon,</hi> or command the Emperour to vſe the materiall ſword, when the neceſſitie of the Church ſhall require and to puniſh him with Eccleſiaſticall puniſhments, if he ſhall refuſe to obey his iuſt command, or <hi>becke,</hi> and I affirmed, that this is the moſt, that can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from thoſe words of <hi>S. Bernard.</hi> But if the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſhould refuſe to vſe the materiall ſword at the <hi>Popes</hi> command, or <hi>becke,</hi> I affirmed, that it could not be inferred from that authoritie of <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> could vſe it himſelfe, or depriue the <hi>Emperour</hi> of his temporall dominion, or power to vſe the materiall ſword, for this were to vſe, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of temporalls, and implyeth a power to vſe, and draw forth the materiall ſword it ſelfe, which <hi>S.

                  <hi>command</hi> temporalls, but to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of temporalls, and to vſe temporalls, as <hi>Ioannes Pariſienſis,</hi> and <hi>Alexander of Hales,</hi>

If that the Emperour ſhall refuſe to vſe the ſword at the becke of the Pope in great neceſſitie of the Church, it is not indeed fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the</hi> Pope <hi>to vſe the materiall ſword, but hee hath power to conſtraine the</hi> Emperour, <hi>firſt with Eccleſiaſticall puniſhments, and afterwards alſo by depriuing him of the ſword, as in the like caſe the Councell of</hi> Lateran <hi>often cited doth teach, which one Councell is to be preferred before all the</hi> Barclaies, <hi>or</hi> Iohns <hi>of</hi> Paris, <hi>all men doe thinke, who are not mad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. Is not this thinke you a trim anſwere? The queſtion betwixt me, and Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this place was not concerning the <hi>Councell of Lateran,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will treat beneath,<note n="*" place="margin">Part. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note> and plainely ſhew, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the clamours of my <hi>Aduerſaries,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Councell</hi> hath neither defined, or ſuppoſed for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, nay or ſuppoſed at all, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depoſe Soueraigne Princes, as <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> doth here collect from thence, but the queſtion was onely concerning the authoritie of S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> And I prooued clearely out of S. <hi>Bernards</hi> wordes, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to command, or forbid in ſome caſes the <hi>vſe</hi> of the materiall ſworde, yet that he hath power, as he is <hi>Pope,</hi> to vſe it himſelfe, or to depriue the <hi>Emperour</hi> of the <hi>vſe</hi> thereof, which implyeth a power to vſe it himſelfe, this I ſaid could not be proued, but rather the contrarie out of thoſe words of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who doth not only ſay, that it is not <hi>fitting</hi> for the <hi>Pope</hi> to vſe the materiall ſword, as D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> would mince his words, but that it is <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> to draw foorth, or vſe the materiall
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20729:137"/>
ſword. Now D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> paſſeth ouer S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and flyeth to the <hi>Councell of Lateran</hi> to proue, that if the <hi>Emperour</hi> refuſe at the <hi>Popes</hi> command to vſe the materiall ſword, he may by the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie bee depriued of the vſe thereof, whereas the preſent que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was only concerning the opinion of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and not what was the doctrine of the <hi>Councell of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> in this point, whoſe authoritie I doe aſmuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect either as Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or any other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like is bound to doe. But it is an eaſie matter to wreſt the words of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> or any other to their purpoſe, contrary to the true meaning of the <hi>Councell,</hi> and then to crie out <hi>ô the Councell of Lateran, which is to be preferred before all</hi> Barclaies, and Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringtons &amp;c. <hi>whereas we doe aſmuch reſpect the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> or any other, as they do, although we doe not ſo much reſpect their ouer wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed collections, which they to ſerue their owne turnes, doe gather from any <hi>Councel,</hi> or text of holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> contrarie to the plaine, proper, and true ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words. But to ſuch ſhiftings, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings euen learned men are ſometimes brought, when they will make their vncertaine opinions, and priuate expoſitions of holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or <hi>Councells</hi> to be <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> grounds of the <hi>Catholike</hi> faith.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Laſtly <hi>but the foundation,</hi> ſaith <hi>D. Schulckenius,</hi> of Widdringtons <hi>errour is, for that he thinketh, that the</hi> Pope <hi>hath authoritie to conſtraine the Emperour by reaſon of the faith, and free promiſe, which the</hi> Emperour <hi>gaue, and made to the</hi> Pope, <hi>according to the ſimilitude, which a little before he put concerning one, who promiſed an other to ſpend his life, and all his goods in defence of him. But this foundation is falſe, becauſe the authoritie of the</hi> Pope <hi>ouer Chriſtian</hi> Princes <hi>doth not proceed from their onely promiſe, or faith, which they haue giuen, but from the law of God, by which law the</hi> Pope <hi>is made by</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour of all his ſtocke, the chiefe of all his familie, the head.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:20729:137"/>
of all his body, and the Rectour of all his Church, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no maruaile, if from falſe foundation he conclude a falſhood to wit, that</hi> S. Bernards <hi>words do not onely, not fauour the</hi> Popes <hi>temporal power, but are flat contrarie to it. What I beſeech you, could be ſpoken more cleerely for the</hi> Popes <hi>temporall power, then that</hi> which S. Bernard <hi>ſaid,</hi> that the temporall ſword is the <hi>Popes,</hi> and that both ſwords are the <hi>Churches,</hi> and that the temporall ſword ought to be drawne foorth at the Popes becke? <hi>And as for</hi> Ioannes Pariſienſis <hi>there is no great reckoning to be made of him whatſoeuer he ſaith, both for that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the</hi> Councell <hi>of</hi> Lateran, <hi>and many others, and alſo that other his errours are condemned by the Church in the common Extrauagant,</hi> Vas electionis, <hi>and laſtly, for that either he denieth only the</hi> Popes <hi>direct power in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls, or elſe he doth plainly contradict himſelfe.</hi>

                     <hi>Num.</hi> 90.91.181.223.341.</note> and D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> doth alſo ſet downe my words, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope</hi> hath power by the <hi>law of God, and for that he is appointed by</hi> Chriſt <hi>to be the ſupreme ſpirituall Paſtour of the Catholike Church,</hi> to conſtraine and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all diſobedient Chriſtians both Princes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall puniſhments;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:20729:138"/>
and yet now this man to perſwade his Reader, that I teach heere a manifeſt <hi>errour,</hi> is not aſhamed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <hi>that I am of opinion, that the Pope hath authoritie to conſtraine the Emperour in regard onely of the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which the Emperour hath made to the Pope.</hi> And therefore D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> neither dealeth truely nor ſincerely, and both deludeth his Reader, and alſo wrongeth mee, in affirming, that to bee my doctrine, which I expreſſely impugne, and that to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my opinion (which hee is pleaſed to call an errour) which I in expreſſe words, and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue denied.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For as I doe willingly grant, that although a temporall Prince hath power to command, and with temporall puniſhments to compell, if neede require, his temporall ſubiects to make, and ſweare an expreſſe promiſe of that true faith, loyaltie and temporall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance, which by the Law of God and nature they doe owe to their lawfull Prince, yet I doe not affirme, that a temporalll Prince hath power to conſtraine his rebellious ſubiects by vertue onely of the promiſe, which they haue made, but by vertue of his ſupreme temporall power which hee hath, as hee is a ſupreme temporall Prince by the Law of God and nature; So alſo I do willingly grant, that although the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to command, and with ſpirituall puniſhments to compell, if neede require, all Chriſtian Princes and people to make and ſweare an expreſſe promiſe of that the true faith, loyalty and ſpirituall allegeance, which as they are Chriſtians and members of the myſticall body of Chriſt, they doe owe by the Law of God to the ſupreme ſpirituall Paſtour and viſible head of this myſticall bodie and Church of Chriſt, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at his coronation taketh ſuch an oath, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I doe not affirme, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to conſtraine and puniſh diſobedient <hi>Princes,</hi> and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by vertue onely of the promiſe, which they haue

               </p>
               <p n="32">32. True it is, that the Reader might the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that to command one to vſe a temporall thing, and to vſe it himſelfe, to command one to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of temporals, and to diſpoſe of them himſelfe, are very different things, and that the one doth not neceſſarily follow from the other, I brought a familiar example of one, who either, <hi>by promiſe,</hi> or <hi>by ſome other obligation</hi> (and yet D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> taketh hold onely of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and cleane omitteth <hi>the other obligation</hi>) is bound to diſpoſe, and giue his goods, or life at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers command, who notwithſtanding this <hi>promiſe,</hi> or other obligation, doth ſtill keepe the property, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and right ouer his goods and life, in such ſort, that the other cannot be vertue of his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power, which he hath ouer him and them, take them away and diſpoſe of them without his conſent, but if hee will not diſpoſe of his goods at the others command, according as by vertue either of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or of ſome other obligation he is bound to doe, the other may complaine to the Magiſtrate, that hee will puniſh him for his offence, or cauſe him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promiſe, ſo far forth as the coerciue power of the Magiſtrate doth extend. From which I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that conſidering to haue the power to command the vſe of the temporall ſword, and to haue a power to vſe it, or to depriue of the vſe thereof, are two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, neither doth one neceſſarily follow from the other, although the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> hath according to S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> power to command the <hi>Emperour</hi> to vſe the temporall ſword, yet it doth not therefore follow that if the <hi>Emperour</hi> will not vſe the temporall ſword at the <hi>Popes</hi> command, the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> can vſe it himſelfe, or depriue the <hi>Emperour</hi> of the vſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:20729:139"/>
thereof, which implieth a power to vſe the ſame, but onely, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> being a ſpirituall Prince or Pſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, may puniſh the Emperor for his contempt with ſpirituall puniſhments, which only doe belong to the <hi>coercive</hi> power of the ſupreme ſpirituall Prince &amp; Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the ſpirituall kingdome &amp; Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="33">33. Thus therefore you haue ſeen, that S. <hi>Bernard</hi> doth nothing fauour, but it is rather flat contrarie to the <hi>Popes</hi> power to vſe the temporall ſword, neither could he ſcarſe ſpeake more cleerely againſt the ſame, then he hath done.

               <p n="38">38 Now to the authoritie of <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> the 8. I anſwer <hi>firſt</hi> that his words are to be vnderſtood in that ſenſe, as I expounded <hi>S.

                  <hi>compare the ſpirituall &amp; temporall power to the Sun &amp; Moone. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the moone is ſubiect to the Sun, for that ſhe receiueth light from the Sun, &amp; the Sun is not ſubiect to the Moone, for that the Sun receiueth nothing from the Moon, ſo alſo a king is ſubiect to the Pope, &amp; the Pope is not ſubiect to a king</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But <hi>firſt</hi> this ſimilitude doth not proue, that the temporall power it ſelfe is ſubiect to the ſpirituall, or, which is all one, that a temporall <hi>King</hi> is ſubiect to the <hi>Pope</hi> in reſpect of his temporall power, which he doth not receiue from the <hi>Pope,</hi> but in reſpect of the light of faith, which a temporall King receiueth from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power. And therefore as the Moone, when ſhe is eclypſed, &amp; in oppoſition to the Sun, doth not looſe that little light, which, according to the doctrin of the Philoſophers and aſtronomers, ſhe hath of her owne nature, and not deriued from the Sunne, ſo temporall Princes, when of Catholikes or Chriſtians they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

                  <hi>he doth</hi> now <hi>exerciſe the power of a ſupreme temporall Prince.</hi> Neither is it only true, that temporall Princes are in ſpiritualls ſubiect to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power of ſpirituall Paſtours, from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſpirituall light, and ſupernaturall directions by the holy Scriptures &amp; Eccleſiaſticall lawes, by which they may ſee how to liue like good Chriſtians, and to attaine to life euerlaſting, but it is alſo true, that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Paſtours, as inferiour Biſhops and Cleargie men are in temporals ſubiect to the temporall power of temporall Princes, from whom they receiue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of naturall light, and ciuill directions by ciuill and temporall Lawes, by which they may ſee, how to conuerſe ciuilly among themſelues and other men, and to attaine to temporall peace and quietneſſe in the ciuill common-wealth.</p>

               <p n="13">13 True it is that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did preach to the <hi>Iewes</hi> the reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the predictions of the holy Prophets, and for this cauſe they accuſed him of ſedition, and to be a man worthy of death, and therefore he appealed to the tribunall of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould iudge, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> was riſen from death to life, for this indeed had been a ſpirituall cauſe, but whether to preach to the <hi>Iewes</hi> the reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the predictions of the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, were ſedition, and a crime worthy to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with death by the Secular Magiſtrate.

                  </note>, <hi>it doth ſeeme to be altogether repugnant to the Goſpell, that Chriſt did not free expreſly, and by name S.</hi> Peter, <hi>and the Apoſtles from the obligation, wherein they ſtood bound to Heathen Princes.

               </p>
               <p n="15">15 But this reaſon is neither ſufficient, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne principles. For <hi>firſt</hi> Card. <hi>Baronius</hi> affirmeth<note n="b" place="margin">Ad ann. Christi <hi>33.</hi> nu. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>that this didrachme,</hi> which was exacted from our Sauiour in this place, was not a tribute due to <hi>Caeſar, but onely to God for the vſe of the Temple, according to the law of God decreed in the</hi> 30. <hi>chapter of</hi> Exodus: And therefore from this place no ſufficient argument can be drawne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Card. <hi>Baronius</hi> doctrine, that the Apoſtes were exempted from paying of tributes, or any other temporall ſubiection, due to temporall Princes. Yea, and which is more, Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe in the latter Editions of his <hi>Controuerſies</hi> approueth this <hi>Expoſition</hi> for moſt true. <hi>There be two interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſaith he<note n="c" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1</hi> de Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricis cap. <hi>28.</hi> in propoſ. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>of this place:</hi> Therefore ſonnes are free. <hi>The former is of</hi> S.

The Kings of the earth, do not exact tribute of their ſonnes but of ſtrangers, therefore the King of heauen will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act tribute of mee, who am his proper and naturall ſonne. The ſecond interpretation, which is of S.</hi> Hierome, <hi>who expoundeth thoſe wordes of the tribute which was to bee paid to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>ſeemeth to bee the leſſe probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the tribute which was to be paid to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>was not a</hi> Didrachme, <hi>but a</hi> penny, <hi>as it is plaine by</hi> Math. 22.

               </p>
               <p n="16">16 Wherefore it is ſtrange, that hee ſhould now be ſo forgetfull, as to bring this text of holy <hi>Scripture</hi> for a reaſon, why hee changed his former opinion, and which reaſon alſo hee ſaith doth <hi>demonſtrate, that</hi> Chriſt <hi>our Sauiour did expreſly, and by name free S.</hi> Peter <hi>and the Apoſtles from the obligation wherein they ſtood bound to Caeſar,</hi> whereas Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, as you haue ſeene, expoundeth this place not of any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to bee paid to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but onely due to <hi>God</hi> for the vſe of the temple.

               </p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>But ſecondly</hi> although wee ſhould grant, that thoſe words of our <hi>Sauiour, therefore ſonnes are free &amp;c.</hi> were meant of the tribute which was to bee paid to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and not to the temple, yet Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did in the former Editions of his Controuerſies giue therevnto a very ſufficient anſwer, and which in his latter Editions he hath not confuted. For thus he writeth<note n="g" place="margin">lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricis Cap. <hi>28.</hi>
                  </note>: <hi>I anſwer firſt that this place doth not conuince: for otherwiſe he ſhould exempt from tributes all Chriſtians, who are regenerate by Baptiſme. Secondly I anſwer, that our Sauiour doth ſpeake onely of himſelfe. For he maketh this Argument: The ſonnes of Kinges are free from tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, becauſe they neither pay tribute to their fathers, for that the goods of the parents and children are common, nor to other Kings, becauſe they are not ſubiect to them, but I am the ſonne of the firſt and chiefeſt King, therefore I owe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:20729:149"/>
tribute to no man. Wherfore when our</hi> Sauiour <hi>ſaith,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sonnes are free, <hi>from thence hee meant onely to gather this, that he himſelfe was not bound to pay tribute: of other men hee affirmed nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19 Thus anſwered Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in times paſt, when he followed the opinion of the Diuines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the exemption of Clergy men againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts, who vrged this place of holy Scriptue to proue, that Clergy men are exempted from paying of tributes by the law of God. But now, <hi>forſooth,</hi> he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh the Diuines, and this very text, <hi>therefore ſonnes are free,</hi> which then hee brought for an obiection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his opinion, and cleerely anſwered the ſame, he bringeth now for a chiefe ground to proue his new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and (which is very remarkable) hee concealeth the anſwer which he then made to the ſaid obiection: onely hee addeth this: <hi>that when the ſonnes of Kings are exempted from tribute, not onely their owne perſons, but alſo their ſeruants and Miniſters, and ſo their families are exempted from tributes. But it is certaine that all Clergie men do properly appertaine to the family of Chriſt, who is the ſonne of the King of Kings. And this our Lord did ſeeme to ſignifie when hee ſaid to S.</hi> Peter, But that wee may not ſcandalize them, finding the ſtater take it, and giue it for me and thee. <hi>As though he ſhould ſay, that both hee, and his family, whereof S.</hi> Peter <hi>was a chiefe gouernour, ought to bee free from tributes. Which alſo S.</hi> Hierome <hi>doth ſeeme to haue vnderſtood in his Commentary of that place, when hee ſaith,</hi> that Clergy men doe not pay tributes for the honour of our Lord, and are as Kings children free from tributes: <hi>and S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>qq.

               <p n="20">20 Thus you ſee, how Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> runneth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:20729:149"/>
vp and downe from the words of holy Scripture, <hi>by which it is demonſtrated,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that S. Peter was not bound to pay tribute to Caeſar,</hi> to the ſenſe which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe diſproueth, and then from the ſenſe to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate collections, and inferences, that if S. <hi>Peter</hi> was free, all the Apoſtles were free, and if all the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, all Cleargie men. But if it had pleaſed him to haue alſo ſet downe the anſwere, which in the former Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his bookes he made to this obiection, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would eaſily haue perceiued, that from this place of holy Scripture no ſufficient reaſon could be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to cauſe him to recall his former opinion, although wee ſhould grant, that thoſe words of our <hi>Sauiour</hi> were meant of the tribute, which was to be paide to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> of which neuertheleſſe Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not haue them to be vnderſtood, but onely of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute which the children of Iſraell were by the law of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. commanded to pay for their ſoules vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vſe of the <hi>tabernacle of teſtimonie,</hi> for at that time the temple was not built. For <hi>firſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if this argument did conuince, not onely Cleargie men, but alſo all Chriſtians, who being regenerate by baptiſme are the children of Chriſt, and alſo doe properly appertaine to his ſpirituall familie, or Church, of which, S.</hi> Peter <hi>and the reſt of the Apoſtles vnder him were chiefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, ſhould be exempted from paying tributes.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>our Sauiour,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>doth ſpeake onely of himſelfe, who was the ſonne of the firſt and chiefeſt King, and that he himſelfe was not bound to pay tribute: of other men he affirmeth nothing.</hi>

cauſe, to wit,</hi> the honor of Chriſt: <hi>for he ſaith, that for his honour Cleargie men doe not pay tributs. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the law of God, but the decrees of Princes made for the honour of Chriſt, haue exempted Cleargy men.</hi> Thus Card. <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>

               <p n="36">36 But ſome doe greatly vrge this obiection: If the ſpirituall power can command temporall Princes not to exerciſe their temporall power ouer the perſons or goods of Cleargie men, without the conſent of their Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiour, it doth conſequently follow, that a temporall Prince doth offend, if he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the iuſt and lawfull command of his ſpirituall Paſtour, and therefore it ſeemeth, that a temporall Prince hath no power ouer the perſons or goods of Cleargie men after ſuch a command, ſuppoſing it to be lawfull, vnleſſe wee will grant, that a temporall Prince hath power to commit ſinne, and to tranſgreſſe the lawfull command of his ſpirituall Paſtour.</p>
               <p n="37">37 To this obiection (wherewith I haue knowne diuers men of learning to bee ſomewhat perplexed) thoſe Catholikes, who deny that the ſpirituall power can depriue by way of <hi>ſentence,</hi> a temporall Prince of his Regall Authority, either wholly or in part, may eaſily anſwer in this manner: that if a temporall Prince doth excerciſe his temporall power ouer the perſons or goods of Clergy men againſt the lawfull command of his ſpirituall Paſtour, hee ſinneth indeed againſt Religion, and the generall vertue of obedience, in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:20729:155"/>
that hee vſeth his power contrary to the lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his ſpirituall Paſtour, but hee doth not ſinne againſt the ſpeciall vertue of legall, or morall iuſtice, in vſing his authority ouer them, who are not his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and ouer whom hee hath no temporall power and Authority, in that manner as another man, who is not their Prince, ſhould offend. Neither is it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſuall for a man to commit a ſinne in doing that which in reſpect of iuſtice hee hath power and authority to doe.</p>
               <p n="38">38 As for example, it is a ſinne againſt the vertue of liberality for one to giue away his goods prodigally, although if wee reſpect iuſtice hee hath true and full power to giue them away, for that he giueth nothing but that, which is his owne: and therefore that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall guift, although it be vnlawfull, yet is not vniuſt, as iuſtice is taken, not as it comprehendeth all vertues in generall, but in particular for a ſpeciall vertue, and one of the foure Cardinall vertues. So alſo it is a ſin againſt the vertue of temperance to giue money to commit an vnhoneſt act, and yet the gift is not vniuſt for that hee giueth nothing but his owne, and which according to iuſtice hee hath power to giue. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if a Ghoſtly father command his penitent to giue a certaine part of his goods to the poore in ſatisfaction of his ſinnes, if the penitent doe beſtow them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then hee was commanded, hee ſinneth againſt the vertue of Religion and Sacrament of pennance, in tranſgreſſing his Ghoſtly fathers lawful command, but he committeth no iniuſtice, becauſe hee giueth that which is his owne, and which, if wee regard the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of iuſtice, hee hath power to giue: neither doth the command of his Ghoſtly father depriue him of the right, dominion, property and power, which he had before ouer thoſe goods.</p>
               <p n="39">39 <hi>Laſtly,</hi> if the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould vpon iuſt cauſe ſuſpend a Prieſt from the Altar, or a Biſhop from his Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:20729:155"/>
function, and conſequently forbid the Prieſt to conſecrate, and the Biſhop to giue orders, if they ſhould diſobey the Popes lawfull command, they ſhould ſinne againſt the vertue of Religion, in vſing their power vnlawfully, but they ſhould not ſinne for doing that which they haue no power to doe, as hee who is no Prieſt or Biſhop ſhould in conſecrating or giuing orders offend, for that the power of a Prieſt to conſecrate and of a Biſhop to giue orders, cannot ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly or in part bee taken away from them by the <hi>Pope.</hi> So likewiſe although a ſpirituall Paſtor ſhould for iuſt cauſe forbid a temporall Prince, who is his ſpirituall child, and ſubiect, to excerciſe his Regall power and authority ouer Clergy men, if that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Prince ſhould heerein tranſgreſſe the command of his ſpirituall Paſtor, ſuppoſing it to bee lawfull, hee ſhould indeed offend againſt religion, in vſing his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall power and authority contrary to the lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his ſpirituall Paſtor, which command was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the motiue of Religion, neuertheleſſe hee ſhould not offend againſt iuſtice, in doing that which hee hath no power and authority to doe, in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as another man, who is not their Prince, ſhould by depriuing them of their goods, or puniſhing their perſons if they tranſgreſſe the lawes, offend. For that it is not in the power of a ſpirituall Paſtor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue a temporall Prince either wholly or in part of his Regall power, and temporall Soueraignty.</p>
               <p n="40">40 Wherefore if wee reſpect the power it ſelfe, and the vertue of legall or morall iuſtice, a temporall Prince hath full, ample, and ſupreme royall power and authority ouer Clergy men, notwithſtanding that his ſpirituall Paſtor ſhould for iuſt cauſe command him not to exerciſe his Regall power vpon the perſons of Clergie men, who doe offend his lawes: but if wee reſpect rhe vſe and execution of the power, and the vertue of religion, the vſe indeed of his power in the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:20729:156"/>
aforeſaid caſe is ſo limited by the lawfull command of the ſpirituall Paſtor, that the Prince vſing his power ouer Clergy men, ſinneth againſt Religion, for that hee diſobeyeth the lawfull command of his ſpirituall Superiour, which was impoſed for the motiue of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but not againſt iuſtice for that hee doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe his Regall power but vpon thoſe who are his Subiects, and doe owe vnto him true loyalty and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall obedience.</p>
               <p n="41">41 And truely if the aforeſaid obiection were of force, that the temporall Prince hath no power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ouer Clergie men, who are ſubiect to him in temporalls, againſt the lawfull command of his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Paſtour, becauſe he hath no power to ſinne, it would likewiſe follow, that a ſuſpended Biſhop, or Prieſt, haue no power to giue orders, or to conſecrate, becauſe they haue no power to ſinne; and a penitent hath no lawfull right, or power to ſell, or giue away his goods againſt the lawfull command of his Ghoſtly Father, becauſe he hath no power to ſinne; and a man hath no power, or right to giue money to a diſhoneſt end, or to giue away his goods prodigally, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they ſhould be reſtored back againe, becauſe he hath no power to ſinne. I will ſay nothing at this time, how farre Cleargie men, either by the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Chriſtan Princes, or by the Eccleſiaſticall Canons are <hi>de facto</hi> exempted both in their goods, and in their perſons from ciuill powers, but onely I thought good at this time to ſet downe the true ſtate of the queſtion among Catholikes concerning the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſpirituall Paſtours to exempt Cleargie men from the temporall power of Chriſtian Princes, that thereby they may clearely perceiue, what kinde of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may be drawne from the exemption of Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie men, to proue the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes, and by way of ſentence to depriue them wholy of their Regall authoritie.</p>
               <p n="42">
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:20729:156"/>42 Thus you haue ſeene in what manner tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thinges are ſubiect to ſpirituall, temporall endes to ſpirituall endes, temporall power to the ſpirituall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the temporall ſword to the ſpirituall ſword, the fleſh to the ſpirit, the Moone to the Sunne, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes to ſpirituall Paſtors; and that from the ſubiection and ſubordination of the temporall power to the ſpirituall, no good argument can be brought to proue, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> by vertue of his ſpirituall power can diſpoſe of temporalls, depoſe temporall Princes, or puniſh temporally by way of <hi>coercion,</hi> but onely that in order to ſpirituall good he can command temporalls, and puniſh temporally by way of <hi>command,</hi> but by way of <hi>coercion</hi> onely with ſpirituall, and not with temporall puniſhments. And by this which hath bene ſaide, the Reader may eaſily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true ſenſe and meaning of a certaine propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his <hi>Schulckenius</hi> doth often inculcate (as though there were ſome great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery lye hidden therein) to proue the Popes power to depoſe temporall Princes, to wit, <hi>that a Chriſtian Prince is a child of the Church, and ſubiect to the Pope, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he is a Chriſtian man, but alſo as he is a Chriſtian Prince;</hi> and the ſame he affirmeth <hi>of a Chriſtian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="43">43 For all theſe three propoſitions, A Chriſtian Prince, as he is a Chriſtian Prince, is a child of the Church, and ſubiect to ſpirituall Paſtours: A Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Prince as he is a Chriſtian is a Child of the Church, and ſubiect to ſpirituall Paſtours: and a Prince as he is a Chriſtian, is a Childe of the Church and ſubiect to ſpirituall Paſtours; haue one and the ſelfe ſame ſenſe; and ſo likewiſe of a Chriſtian Lawier, of a Chriſtian Soldier, of a Chriſtian Phyſitian &amp;c. For the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them all is, that Chriſtianitie, and not Regall authority, or the knowledge of lawe, warfare, or
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:20729:157"/>
Phyſicke, is the cauſe why a Prince, a Lawier, a Soldier, a Phyſitian, and all other men of what trade ſoeuer they be, are Children of the Church, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſpirituall Paſtours; and that therefore they are to be directed and inſtructed by ſpirituall Paſtours, not preciſely in the rules of ciuill gouernment, in the rules of lawe, warfare, or Phyſicke, but onely in the rules and principles of Chriſtian doctrine, and how they ought to gouerne ciuilly, and vſe their knowledge and trades according to the rules and precepts of Chriſtian Religion: which if they refuſe to doe, they may be corrected and puniſhed by ſpirituall Paſtours, with ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall puniſhments.</p>
               <p n="44">44 But from hence it doth not follow, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporall power, the knowledge of the lawe, warfare, or phyſicke, are among Chriſtians <hi>per ſe</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ſpirituall power, but onely <hi>per accidens,</hi> as I haue often declared, and in thoſe thinges, which doe concerne or belong to Chriſtian Religion, or that ſpirituall Paſtours can by vertue of their ſpirituall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er correct, or puniſh Chriſtian Princes, Lawiers, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Phyſitians &amp;c. by depriuing them by way of ſentence of their Regall authoritie, of their ſkill and knowledge in the lawes, in warfare, or Phyſicke, which they did not receiue from the ſpirituall power, but onely by depriuing them of the Sacraments, and ſuch like ſpirituall benifites, of which they are made partakers by being Chriſtians, and by meanes of the ſpirituall power and authority of ſpirituall Paſtours. And thus much concerning the vnion and ſubiection of the temporall and ſpirituall power, and alſo of the ſecond part.</p>

grounded his conſequence, I onely demanded, not by way of <hi>ſcoffing, cogging, gibing, or making my ſelfe merry,</hi> as this man in this, and his former Chapter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely affirmeth, but rather out of pitty, compaſsion, and complaint, <hi>whether thoſe, and ſuch like were not trim Arguments to moue Engliſh Catholicks prodigally to caſt away their goods, and to deny their allegiance to their Prince.</hi> And as for charging my Aduerſary with <hi>flat falſity,</hi> my wordes were onely theſe: <hi>Thirdly it is falſe which this Author F.

                  </gap>his Oath, as impious and hereticall, for this doctrine onely is abiured in this Oath as</hi> impious and hereticall, <hi>that Princes being excommunicated or depriued by the Pope, may bee depoſed or murthered by their ſubiects or any other whatſoeuer: which poſition, as I will declare beneath, hath this ſenſe, that it is in the free power of Subiects to depoſe, or (if they will) to murther their Prince, beeing excommunicated, or depriued by the Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 In the very firſt beginning I affirmed, and Mr. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> in his firſt Chapter related my words, <hi>that the ſuppoſition, which hee made, to wit, that the Popes power to excommunicate Princes is denyed in this Oath, is moſt falſe</hi> and then he took no exception againſt this word, <hi>moſt falſe:</hi> and now after he hath ſo often fallen very foule vpon mee, with charging mee with being <hi>abſurd, ridiculous, fooliſh, malicious, impudent, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,</hi> with <hi>cogging, ſcoffing gibing, heretike, and being no good Child of the Catholike Church,</hi> and vſing many ſuch like ſlanderous, and diſgracefull termes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee, hee taketh it very ill for that I onely affirme his aſſertion to bee <hi>falſe,</hi> which word neuertheleſſe is vſuall in Schooles among Diſputers and Anſwerers, and is not taken for any diſgracefull tearme, being in ſenſe all one with <hi>vntrue,</hi> or <hi>I deny the aſſertion or poſition.</hi> But becauſe I perceiue Mr. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> patience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20729:159"/>
brooke the very leaſt of thoſe ſo many foule, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull, and ſlanderous nicknames hee is pleaſed to beſtow vpon me, and doth ſo eaſily <hi>ſee a little mote in my eye, not perceiuing the great beame in his owne:</hi> I will heereafter abſtaine from that word <hi>falſe,</hi> and in ſtead thereof vſe <hi>vntrue,</hi> as in the Engliſh Edition I did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it: neither can he haue any colour to bee diſtaſted with this word <hi>vntrue,</hi> vnleſſe hee doe take it ill that I doe not <hi>forſooth</hi> approue all his opinions, and applaud whatſoeuer he ſhall ſay to be true.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But to the matter. Mr. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> in his fourth Chapter endeauoreth to proue two things: the <hi>one</hi> that I haue falſly charged him with affirming, <hi>that the Doctrine for the Popes power to depoſe Princes, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly abiured in the Oath, as impious and hereticall,</hi> which hee denyeth to haue affirmed, although hee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth withall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat it is true if hee had affirmed it. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, <hi>that my interpretation of that clauſe of the Oath, wherein the aforeſaid Doctrine and Poſition,</hi> That Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being excommunicated or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed or murthered by their Subiects, <hi>is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured as</hi> impious and hereticall, <hi>is abſurd according to my owne grounds.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. As touching the <hi>firſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> affirmeth,<note n="a" place="margin">

               <hi>that he ſaith nothing at all touching his owne opinion, whether the doctrine of depoſing Princes be abiured in the Oath</hi> as impious and hereticall <hi>(and much leſſe that it is manifestly abiured as I ſay he doth) but he affirmeth onely, that the Oath is wholy repugnant to a Canon of the great Councell of</hi> Lateran <hi>by reaſon of two clauſes therein.</hi> And for proofe thereof, he repeateth<note n="b" place="margin">

And I do further ſweare, that from my hart I doe abhorre, deteſt, &amp; abiure, as impious and heretical, this damnable doctrin, and poſition,</hi> that princes excommunicated or depriued by the Pope may be depoſed, <hi>which poſition was by that Canon expreſly ordained to be practiſed in ſome caſes, yea and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the Councells order vpon</hi> Reymond <hi>Earle of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſa.

               <hi>me to the indifferent Reader, whether I affirme any more, then that theſe two clauſes of the Oath are flatly againſt the Councell of Lateran, becauſe the Popes power to depoſe Princes (which the ſaid Councell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth and approueth by an expreſſe Canon) is denied therein; and this is manifeſt as well by all my precedent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as by that which followeth; for all that which I am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply debated before, touching the Councell of</hi> Lateran, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned onely the Popes power to depoſe Princes, without any one word whether the abiuration or deniall thereof be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall; and my concluſion of the later clauſe confirmeth the ſame: for I add immediately theſe words,</hi> which poſition, (to wit, that Princes being excommunicated or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued by the Pope may be depoſed) was by that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non expreſly ordained to be practiſed in ſome caſes; yea and was executed by the Councels order, vpon <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> Earle of Toloſa.</p>

So as my Aduerſary</hi> Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington <hi>charging me to haue</hi> falſly affirmed, that the Popes power to depoſe Princes is manifeſtly abiured in this Oath, <hi>hath charged me falſely, and therefore may take his imputation of falſity to himſelfe.</hi> Thus M. <hi>Fitzherbert.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="45">45 From whence I inferred, that in a <hi>diſiunctiue</hi> propoſition, wherein is implied a <hi>condition</hi> of the will to chooſe freely either part of the <hi>diſiunction,</hi> it maketh the ſame ſenſe, whether the coniunction <hi>copulatiue, [and]</hi> or the <hi>diſiunctiue [or]</hi> be vſed: for both of them doe import a free election to take which part one pleaſeth, and ſo the coniunction <hi>diſiunctiue</hi> hath in ſenſe the vertue of a <hi>copulatiue,</hi> and the <hi>copulatiue</hi> the vertue of a <hi>diſiunctiue.</hi> And this I confirmed both by the authority of the ancient Fathers, and alſo of Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, who doe confound <hi>[and]</hi> with <hi>[or]</hi> and <hi>[or]</hi> with <hi>[and]</hi> in propoſitions which doe imply a free election to chooſe which part they will.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20729:174"/>
of all men, who in a <hi>conditionall diſiunctiue</hi> propoſition make <hi>[or] equiualent</hi> to <hi>[and]</hi> and <hi>[and]</hi> to <hi>[or].</hi> Neuertheleſſe this I muſt needs ſay, that it might be perchance an error of the <hi>Printer,</hi> which alſo if it had bene, me thinkes that Card. <hi>Bellarmine, Capellus,</hi> or <hi>Fa.

And my reaſon is, becauſe it ſeemeth, that there was but one onely <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the Oath out of Engliſh, which is extant in publike writings, from which all thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who haue ſet downe the oath in Latin, haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, as <hi>firſt</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> in his <hi>Breue,</hi> then Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Fa.

            <p n="73">73 Now, as I haue often ſaid, a <hi>conditionall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiue</hi> propoſition, whch implyeth a free choice to take both parts of the diſiunction, if wee pleaſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a true <hi>diſiunctiue</hi> propoſition, by reaſon of the <hi>diſiunctiue</hi> coniunction <hi>[or]</hi> yet, for as much as concerneth the truth or falſhood of the propoſition, it followeth the nature &amp; quality of a <hi>copulatiue,</hi> and not of a <hi>common diſiunctiue</hi> propoſition, for which reaſon, I affirmed that although it was a <hi>diſiunctiue</hi> propoſition, yet by reaſon of the choice, freedome, or indifferency to take either part of the <hi>diſiunction,</hi> it was <hi>equiualent</hi> to a <hi>copulatiue</hi> propoſition.

ſeeme to be any way inſinuated in the oath as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by his <hi>opinion</hi> concerning his Primacie in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, and the <hi>Popes</hi> power to <hi>excommunicate</hi> him, and ſuch like, which neuertheleſſe he doth not intend, that his Subjects ſhall be bound to affirme or deny in this oath; wee muſt not I ſay, ſo much regard his <hi>opinion,</hi> as his <hi>intention,</hi> and what is the true <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of the <hi>oath according to the plain and common vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the words,</hi> to which his <hi>Maiesty</hi> doth bind the taker, and what <hi>by vertue of the words</hi> we muſt <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, profeſſe, deteſt,</hi> and <hi>abiure</hi> in this <hi>oath:</hi> Now it is euident, as I haue ſhewed before, that my opinion is not different from the ſubſtance of the oath, nor from that which his <hi>Maieſty</hi> intendeth to bind the ſwearer to <hi>acknowledge,</hi> or <hi>abiure</hi> in this oath.</p>
            <p n="136">136. For I affirme two things, which are the whole ſubſtance of the oath; The <hi>first,</hi> is that any Catholike may <hi>lawfully,</hi> and with a <hi>ſafe conſcience declare, teſtifie, and acknowledge, before God, and in his conſcience, that the Pope hath no power to depoſe his</hi> Maieſty, <hi>nor to diſpoſe of any his king<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omes, or Dominions,</hi> and ſo of the other clauſes, which doe follow from this doctrine. And my reaſon is, for that the doctrine for the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes, I will not ſay at this preſent, is a <hi>falſe</hi> doctrine, and <hi>repugnant</hi> to the holy Scriptures, and to the ancient Fathers, but it is not <hi>certaine,</hi> and a point of faith, (as Maiſter <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> and ſome others of his companie will needs haue it to be) and the <hi>contrary</hi> is <hi>probable</hi> and conſequently may with a <hi>ſafe</hi> and <hi>probable</hi> conſcience be acknowledged and maintained by any Catholike. But whether it be <hi>probable,</hi> that the Pope hath power to depoſe Princes or no, I doe not at this preſent diſpute, neither doe I either grant it, or deny it, or meddle at all therewith, as being vnneceſſary to proue the <hi>oath</hi> to be lawfull. That which I affirme at this time is, that it is <hi>probable,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no ſuch power. Let vs firſt agree
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20729:206"/>
about this point, that it is <hi>probable,</hi> that the Pope hath no ſuch power, and then we will diſpute, how <hi>probable</hi> it is, that he hath ſuch a power. In the meane time all Mr. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> cunning, turning, and winding ſhall not draw mee to ſo great a diſaduantage, as to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee to proue that to be <hi>certaine,</hi> which he, and the reſt of my <hi>Aduerſaries</hi> will not grant to be ſo much as <hi>probable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="137">137. The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing, which touching <hi>practiſe</hi> I doe affirme, is, that this doctrine and poſition, <hi>That Princes, which be excommunicated or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed by their Subiects or any other,</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit now the word <hi>[murthered]</hi> is an <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> doctrine, and in what ſenſe it may be called <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi> as alſo whether <hi>by vertue of the words</hi> both parts of that <hi>diſiunctiue</hi> poſition contained in the oath are abiured alike, and whether there be the ſame reaſon, that the <hi>depoſing,</hi> and <hi>murthering</hi> of Princes ſhould be abiured <hi>alike,</hi> I haue ſufficiently declared before. Whereby it may alſo appeare, that my doctrine brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth no danger at all to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> as that of my <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries</hi> doth, but giueth great ſecurity both to his <hi>Maieſties</hi> perſon and State, as alſo I haue noted before in the Preface<note n="y" place="margin">nu. <hi>61.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note>, which the Reader would quickly haue perceaued, if Mr. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> had not guilfully, to diſgrace mee with his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> concealed the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt part of my anſweare and doctrine touching the ſecurity, which it gaue to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> for which cauſe hee hath laboured ſo much to haue my bookes forbidden, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may not ſee my anſweares and doctrine, but after that mangled, and lame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as hee is pleaſed to curtoll and diſfigure them.</p>
            <p n="138">138. <hi>Thirdly, it is euident,</hi> ſaith Mr. Fitzherbert,<note n="z" place="margin">
                  <hi>nu.</hi> 31.</note> 
               <hi>that neither</hi> Widdrington, <hi>nor any man that followeth his doctrine, can lawfully ſweare this clauſe of the oath, whereof wee treat: for no man can with ſafe conſcience abiure, as</hi> impious and hereticall, <hi>any opinion, which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20729:207"/>
hee houldeth to be</hi> probable, <hi>as</hi> Widdrington <hi>granteth our opinion to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="139">139. But on the contrary part I ſay, that it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that any man who followeth my doctrine, may lawfully ſweare this clauſe of the oath, whereof wee treat: for any man may with ſafe conſcience <hi>abiure,</hi> as <hi>impious and hereticall,</hi> that doctrine and poſition, which is truely as <hi>impious and hereticall:</hi> Neither doe I grant, that the doctrine and poſition contained in this clauſe of the oath, which, as you ſee, belongeth to <hi>practiſe,</hi> is <hi>probable,</hi> as my Aduerſary vntruely affirmeth, but I acknowledge, that it is a <hi>falſe, damnable, impious,</hi> and <hi>hereticall</hi> doctrine, and that therefore it ought by all Catholikes to be <hi>abhorred, deteſted, and abiured ſo from their hearts,</hi> as I haue cleerely proued before: and as for the ſpeculatiue doctrine of <hi>depoſing</hi> Princes. I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grant, nor deny it to be <hi>probable,</hi> nor medle at all therewith, as being <hi>impertinent,</hi> as I haue often ſaid, to proue that the <hi>oath</hi> may lawfully be taken.</p>
            <p n="140">140 <hi>Laſtly, I conclude,</hi> ſaith M. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>nu.</hi> 32.</note>, <hi>that albeit there were no other thing in the oath to make it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, yet this onely clause might ſuffice to doe it yea and ought to moue all Catholikes to refuſe it.

So as thou ſeeſt,</hi> good Reader, <hi>what</hi> Widdrington <hi>gaineth by his wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, ſeeing that the further he goeth, the further he intangleth himſelfe ſtill in an inextricable labyrinth of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, whiles he ſeeketh to intangle the conſciences of Catholikes in the ſnares of his pretended probabilities. And this ſhall ſuffice for this point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="141">141. But contrariwiſe I conclude, that this clauſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20729:207"/>
is not ſufficient to make the <hi>oath</hi> vnlawfull, or to moue any Catholike to refuſe the ſame. For ſurely he muſt be a Catholike of a ſtrange conſcience, and <hi>caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the like fanaticall zeale and bloody maximes that the Powder-Traitors were,</hi> that can perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that the <hi>murthering</hi> of Princes, being excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated or depriued by the Pope, and the doctrine thereof, which is a part of that <hi>conditionall diſiunctiue</hi> propoſition, abiured in this clauſe of the oath, ought not to be <hi>deteſted, abhorred and abiured from his heart:</hi> Neither was this doctrine euer taught before in the Church of God by any Catholike writer, ancient or moderne, or confirmed by the practiſe of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, or authority of any Generall or Prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Councell.</p>
            <p n="142">142. And although the doctrine for the Popes power to depoſe Princes by way of <hi>ſentence</hi> hath bene taught by many Catholike writers, and alſo <hi>practised</hi> by diuers Popes, onely ſince the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeauenth, who was the <hi>firſt Pope,</hi> ſaith <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> that <hi>contrary to the cuſtome of his anceſtors, durst, I doe not ſay excommunicate, but alſo depriue</hi> Caeſar <hi>himſelfe (by whom if he was not choſen, he was at least confirmed) of his Kingdome and Empire: A thing not heard of before thoſe times</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">See aboue part <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi> nu. <hi>24.</hi>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20729:208"/>
thruſt a King out of his Kingdome, which he lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſeth, ſo long as the controuerſie betwixt the Pope, and temporall Princes, touching this point remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vndecided.</p>
            <p n="143">143. For it is manifeſt, according to the knowne, and approued rule of the law, which is alſo grounded vpon the light of reaſon, that no man can lawfully be thruſt out from the poſſeſſion of that thing, which he rightfully and lawfully poſſeſſeth, vntill the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie betwixt him and his <hi>Aduerſary</hi> touching that thing be decided by the Iudge. And for this reaſon, as I coniecture, Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and ſome fewe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his <hi>Society</hi> haue of late yeares bene ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make this doctrine for the <hi>Popes</hi> power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes to be a <hi>Point of faith,</hi> and not to be called in queſtion by any Catholike, foreſeing belike that if they granted it to be <hi>diſputable,</hi> and a thing in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie among Catholikes, they muſt conſequently grant, that the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoſe Princes, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>titulus ſinere,</hi> and can neuer be lawfully put in <hi>pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe,</hi> much like to the <hi>title</hi> which one hath to a faire Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, whereof an other man is in poſſeſſion, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he ſhall neuer by <hi>diſpoſſeſſing</hi> the other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enioy, vntill the Iudge hath <hi>decided</hi> his <hi>title.</hi> And therefore the <hi>practiſe</hi> not onely touching the <hi>murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> of Princes excommunicated or depriued by the <hi>Pope,</hi> but alſo touching the <hi>depoſing</hi> them, or <hi>thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them out of the poſſeſſion of their kingdomes, and the doctrine thereof, may and ought by all good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes to be <hi>deteſted, abhorred, and abiured from their hearts,</hi> although <hi>by vertue of the words, and by force of the diſiunctiue</hi> coniunction <hi>[or]</hi> following the verbe <hi>[may]</hi> it ſufficeth, as I ſhewed before, to abiure the whole <hi>diſiunctiue</hi> poſition, <hi>as hereticall,</hi> that one onely part of the <hi>diſiunction</hi> be abiured <hi>as hereticall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="144">144. So as thou ſeeſt, good Reader, both that the <hi>probabilitie,</hi> which I mainetaine, is not onely preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20729:208"/>
but true and reall, and alſo to render backe Mr. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> words, what he gaineth by his <hi>wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and <hi>concealing</hi> the chiefe points of my opinion and doctrine, ſeeing that the further hee goeth, the further hee bewrayeth his want both of learning and ſincerity, &amp; <hi>intangleth</hi> himſelfe ſtill in an inextricable labyrinth of abſurdities, whiles hee ſeeketh to intangle the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Catholikes in the ſnares of his <hi>preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded new Catholike faith;</hi> which for that it is, end euer hath beene euen from the very firſt broaching thereof, impugned by learned Catholikes, as a new inuented doctrine, preiudiciall to the Soueraigntie of temporal Princes, and not acknowledged by any one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, cleerely conuinceth, that it is not <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.</hi> Neither can that man be accounted a true <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,</hi> who with <hi>Catholike</hi> faith, which cannot be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to errour, beleeueth that doctrine, which is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, diſputable, vncertaine, and not <hi>Catholike,</hi> as is this, which teacheth that the Pope hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes. And truely if I ſhould perceiue my <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi> faith to rely and depend vpon ſo weak a ground and foundation, as is the Popes authority to depoſe Princes, or any other ſuch like diſputable queſtion, I ſhould ſcarce thinke my ſelfe to be a <hi>true Catholike,</hi> and to haue a <hi>true Catholike</hi> and ſupernaturall, but onely a <hi>pretended Catholike,</hi> and ſupernaturall faith.</p>
