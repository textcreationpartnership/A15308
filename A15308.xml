         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But that this is no conuincing proofe, I Å¿hewed clearely in my <hi>Apologie</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Num <hi>404.</hi> &amp; Å¿eq.</note>. For the Romane Empire was not inÅ¿tituted by the authoritie of the Romane Church, Å¿eeing that he was inÅ¿tituted before there was any Romane Church at all, and continued for a long time together the <hi>Soueraigne Lord</hi> in temporalls of the Romane Church. Neither was the Romane Empire tranÅ¿lated from the Grecians to the Germans or French men by the grant of the Romane Church, if by the <hi>Romane Church</hi> be meant onely the <hi>Cleargie of Rome,</hi> but it was tranÅ¿lated by the grant, Å¿uffrages, and authoritie alÅ¿o of the <hi>Laitie,</hi> who in the weÅ¿t parts were Å¿ubiect to the Romane Empire. True alÅ¿o it is, that all Catholike Princes ought to be Patrons, defenders, and protectours of the Romane Church (but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperour more Å¿pecially) they being children
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20729:58"/>
and members of the Catholike Romane Church, and euery member is bound to defend eath other, but eÅ¿pecially to defend the head. And therefore I will eaÅ¿ily grant, that the Pope may exact, if need require, not only of the Romane Emperour, but alÅ¿o of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholike Princes an oath of Å¿pirituall allegiance, but that Catholike Princes are Å¿ubiect to the Pope in temporalls, and that the Pope may exact of them an oath of temporall allegiance, this is that I vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, neither will Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or any other be able by any Å¿ufficient argument to conuince the contrary; wherefore it cannot with any Å¿hew of probabilitie be denied, but that we haue the teÅ¿timonie of <hi>Albericus,</hi> a man excellently learned, and a ClaÅ¿Å¿icall Doctour, that the Pope hath no authoritie to depoÅ¿e Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes, and to diÅ¿poÅ¿e of their temporall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>

               <p n="6">6 Concerning which queÅ¿tion there is a great controuerÅ¿ie betwixt the CanoniÅ¿ts, and Diuines.

But contrariwiÅ¿e the Diuines, who doe hold, that ChriÅ¿t as man, was not a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but only a Å¿pirituall King, and although hee had directly both temporall and Å¿pirituall power, yet that he gaue to <hi>S.

                  </note> pretended to confute concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> Å¿pirituall and temporall Monarchie ouer the whole ChriÅ¿tian world. For if the Church of ChriÅ¿t be one totall body or common-wealth compounded of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical and ciuill pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as a man is compounded of Å¿oule and body (for this is that Å¿imilitude which Å¿o much pleaÅ¿eth Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and is therefore Å¿o often inculcated by him) it muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow, that the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> in whom, according to his other grounds, all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Church doth reÅ¿ide, muÅ¿t haue truly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and formally both temporall and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power, as a man who is compounded of Å¿oule and bodie, hath truely, properly and formally in him both the Å¿oule and bodie, and all the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties

of them both: And what elÅ¿e is this, I pray you, then to maintaine with the <hi>CanoniÅ¿ts,</hi> that the Pope as Pope is both a temporall and Å¿pirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and that hee hath truely, properly and formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both ciuill and Å¿pirituall authority: And yet Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in other places doth expreÅ¿Å¿ely affirme, that the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope</hi> hath onely Å¿pirituall and not temporall power.</p>

And therefore when we Å¿peake properly, we Å¿ay that the Pope hath power in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, but not that he hath temporall power, as he is Pope.</hi> Now how theÅ¿e two can Å¿tand together, that the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall power among ChriÅ¿tians doe make one entire and totall body, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is the Å¿upreme viÅ¿ible head, as the body and Å¿oule doe make one man, and yet that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> Å¿hall haue no temporall power, which in it Å¿elfe is tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but onely Å¿pirituall, athough in Å¿ome caÅ¿es ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to temporall things, Å¿eeing that theÅ¿e two powers doe truely compoÅ¿e the Church of <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and conÅ¿equently both of them are truly and really in the Church which they compound, and Å¿o likewiÅ¿e in the <hi>Pope,</hi> in whom all the power of the Church doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide, I remit to the iudgement of any Å¿enÅ¿ible man.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

For how can the Church of ChriÅ¿t be compounded of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and Å¿pirituall power, which are formally two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct powers, and yet the Church not haue power which is formally ciuill, but onely Å¿pirituall?

                  </note>. <hi>TheÅ¿e two powers in the Church,</hi> Å¿aith hee, <hi>are like to the Å¿pirit and body in a man. For the body &amp; the Å¿pirit are as it were two common-wealths, which may be found diuided and vnited. The body is found without the Å¿pirit in beaÅ¿ts, the Å¿pirit is found without the body in Angels, the body and Å¿pirit are both vnited in man, and doe make one perÅ¿on. So likewiÅ¿e, the ciuill and Å¿pirituall power are Å¿omtimes found diuided, as long Å¿ince in the ApoÅ¿tles time, Å¿omtimes vnited as now,

The <hi>Å¿econd</hi> is, that ChriÅ¿tian Princes, although in temporalls, and in things belonging to ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are Å¿upreme on earth, and therefore Å¿ubiect to none, yet in that they are ChriÅ¿tians, they are Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in Å¿pirituals, and in things belonging to ChriÅ¿tian Religion to the command of Å¿pirituall PaÅ¿tours of the flocke of <hi>ChriÅ¿t.</hi> For theÅ¿e bee the expreÅ¿Å¿e wordes, which he vÅ¿ed to the ChriÅ¿tian PreÅ¿ident: <hi>For the law of ChriÅ¿t doth make you alÅ¿o Å¿ubiect to my power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, for we alÅ¿o haue authoritie to command, I add alÅ¿o, a more noble, and more perfect, vnleÅ¿Å¿e it be meete, that the Å¿pirit do Å¿ubmit her power to the fleÅ¿h, and heauenly things doe giue place to earthly.</hi> From which words this onely can be inferred, that the Å¿pirituall power is more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then the temporall, and that all ChriÅ¿tian Princes and MagiÅ¿trates, as they are the Å¿heepe of <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> are in Å¿pirituall things Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall PaÅ¿tours of the Church, which all Catholikes will freely grant. But that the temporall and Å¿pirituall power among ChriÅ¿tians, as they are referred to the Å¿upreme viÅ¿ible heads here on earth, do make one totall body or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, as the Å¿oule and body do make one man, or that the temporall power among ChriÅ¿tians, as it is temporall (for this much doth Å¿ignifie the temporall and Å¿pirituall power taking them <hi>in abÅ¿tracto</hi>) or which is all one, that temporall Princes are in meere tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauÅ¿es Å¿ubiect to Å¿pirituall PaÅ¿tours, cannot with any Å¿hew of probabilitie bee gathered out of thoÅ¿e words of S. <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>FIrÅ¿t</hi> therefore, that you may perceiue the true Å¿tate of the queÅ¿tion, and wherein I doe agree with <hi>Card: Bellarmine,</hi> and wherein we differ, I doe agree with him in this, that ChriÅ¿tian Princes, in whom the Å¿upreme temporall power doth reÅ¿ide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Å¿heepe of ChriÅ¿t, no leÅ¿Å¿e then inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, are Å¿ubiect to the Å¿upreme viÅ¿ible PaÅ¿tour of the Church of ChriÅ¿t: but the queÅ¿tion is, in what things, and alÅ¿o in what manner they are Å¿ubiect. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we alÅ¿o agree in this, that ChriÅ¿tian Princes are in Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, or which doe belong to ChriÅ¿tian faith and Religion, Å¿ubiect not onely to the directiue, or commanding power, but alÅ¿o in Å¿pirituall puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the coerciue or puniÅ¿hing power of Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall PaÅ¿tors, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that ChriÅ¿tian Princes are not onely bound to obey the command of their Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall PaÅ¿tors, in things which doe concerne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian faith and religion, but alÅ¿o, if they be diÅ¿obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they may with Å¿pirituall puniÅ¿hments he puniÅ¿hed and compelled therevnto. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we doe alÅ¿o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, that ChriÅ¿tian Princes are bound to obey the commanding power of Å¿pirituall PaÅ¿tours, not only in thoÅ¿e things, which of their owne nature are

And therefore although temporall good, or felicity be not abÅ¿olutely the laÅ¿t end of man, yet it is the laÅ¿t end of the temporall power it Å¿elfe, which is in man. For euery power, as it is a power, hath for her laÅ¿t end, her act or worke, as euery Å¿cience hath of it owne nature for her laÅ¿t end the knowledge of her obiect, and euery art the effecting of her work, (as the laÅ¿t end of naturall philoÅ¿ophie is to know the Å¿ecrets of nature, and of PhiÅ¿ike to cure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue the body from diÅ¿eaÅ¿es) although man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe, in whom that power, art, or Å¿cience doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide, doth intend a farther end.

thing, and eternall felicitie, which conÅ¿iÅ¿teth in the cleere viÅ¿ion and fruition of almighty God, is Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and goeth beyond the bounds, limits, and order of nature, no man can make any doubt; and therefore temporall peace cannot of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be referred to eternall felicity; but onely by the will and intention of man, who by the helpe of Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall light and grace doth referre it, direct it, and eleuate it to that Å¿upernaturall end.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="7">7. Seeing therefore that ChriÅ¿tian Religion doth not take away true ciuill power, as <hi>Card. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himÅ¿elfe alÅ¿o in another place affirmeth<note n="g" place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Rom. Pont. cap. <hi>29.</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20729:96"/>
or an Infidell, in this Å¿ubiect, or in that, it neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arily followeth, that if true ciuill power bee not of it own nature Å¿ubiect, or Å¿ubordained in Infidels to true Å¿pirituall, or EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical power, it is not alÅ¿o in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians <hi>per Å¿e,</hi> and of it own nature Å¿ubiect or Å¿ubordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to true Å¿pirituall or EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall power. This onely alteration hath ciuill power for being in this Å¿ubiect, or in that, in Infidels, or in ChriÅ¿tians, that ChriÅ¿tians ought, according to the true grounds of ChriÅ¿tian Religion, referre it by the aide of true Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall faith to a true Å¿upernaturall end, to which Infidels, who want true Å¿upernaturall faith, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it: but this alteration is extrinÅ¿ecall or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, not intrinÅ¿ecall or eÅ¿Å¿entiall, neither doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the nature of the ciuill power it Å¿elfe, but from the wil &amp; intention of him, in whom true ciuill power doth reÅ¿ide.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Å¿ubiection, Å¿ubordination, or relation of true ciuill power to the Å¿pirituall, proceedeth from the intention of him, in whom the ciuill power doth reÅ¿ide, who according to his faith and religion (bee it true or falÅ¿e) referreth his true ciuill power to a true or falÅ¿e Religion, to a true or falÅ¿e worÅ¿hipping of God, and not from the nature, or any intrinÅ¿ecal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the true ciuill power it Å¿elfe which, as it is the Å¿ame in Infidels and ChriÅ¿tians, or in whatÅ¿oeuer Å¿ubiect it be Å¿o alÅ¿o of it own nature hath the Å¿ame end as well in Infidels as in ChriÅ¿tians, to wit, temporall peace, to which of it owne nature it is alwaies refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

Neither doth S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or S. <hi>Austin</hi> affirme the contrary, but confirme what I haue Å¿ayd.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For although S. <hi>AuÅ¿tin</hi> doth affirme, <hi>that all theÅ¿e &amp; Å¿uch like wils haue their proper ends, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the end of that will, wherby we deÅ¿ire to liue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, and to come to that life, which is not referred to any other thing, but it doth of it Å¿elfe Å¿atisfie the Louer,</hi> yet he doth not Å¿ay, that theÅ¿e proper ends, are <hi>per Å¿e,</hi> and of their owne nature referred to euerlaÅ¿ting happineÅ¿Å¿e, but he doth rather in expreÅ¿Å¿e words Å¿ay, that they are by Å¿ome particular will, or intention of man referred to euerlaÅ¿ting happineÅ¿Å¿e.

                  <hi>that all wils are well connected together, if that will be good, whereunto all the reÅ¿t be referred, but if that bee bad, all the other wils are bad.</hi> So that S. <hi>AuÅ¿tin</hi> cannot be Å¿o vnderÅ¿tood, that all thoÅ¿e wils are <hi>per Å¿e,</hi> and of their owne nature referred to a good, or to a bad will, for that a will, which of it owne nature is good can not of it owne nature be referred to a bad will, or to a bad end. And therefore when S. <hi>AuÅ¿tin</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>that the will to Å¿ee a skarre hath for her proper end the Å¿eeing of a skarre, and no farther appertaineth to her,</hi> hee vnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the laÅ¿t end, which the will to Å¿ee a skar hath <hi>per Å¿e,</hi> and of it owne nature, and when he Å¿aith, <hi>that it may be referred to a farther end, good or bad,</hi> he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tandeth of a farther end, not which it hath of <hi>it owne nature,</hi> but which it hath by Å¿ome other will or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may be good or bad, according as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth all the other wils to a good or bad end.</p>

For in regard of the order of charitie, one common-wealth is not bound to Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer detriment, that an other common-wealth more noble doe not Å¿uffer the like detriment. And one priuate man, who is bound to giue all his goods for the conÅ¿eruation of his owne common-wealth, is not bound to doe the like for an other common-wealth, although the more noble. Seeing therefore that the temporall common-wealth is bound to Å¿uffer detriment for the Å¿piritual common-weatlh, it is a Å¿igne that they are not two diuerÅ¿e common-wealths, but parts of one and the Å¿ame common-wealth, and one Å¿ubiect to the other.</hi>

And although one priuate man, who is bound to giue all his goods for the conÅ¿eruation of his owne common-wealth, bee not bound to doe the like for an other common-wealth, although the more noble, yet in caÅ¿e that the Å¿ame priuate man Å¿hould at the Å¿ame time bee a Citizen of both common-wealths, if he be bound to giue all his goods for the conÅ¿eruation of the leÅ¿Å¿e noble common wealth, whereof he is a Citizen, he is much more bound for the Å¿ame order of charitie, to giue all his goods for the conÅ¿eruation of the more noble common wealth, to which alÅ¿o he is Å¿ubiect. And this is the very caÅ¿e in this preÅ¿ent queÅ¿tion. For the Å¿pirituall and ciuill power, and the common wealths which they compound, are Å¿o vnited and connected among ChriÅ¿tians, that euery ChriÅ¿tian is a Citizen of both common wealths, and both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths may be Å¿ubiect to the Å¿ame Prince, as appeareth in the <hi>Pope,</hi> who is the Å¿pirituall Prince or PaÅ¿tour of the whole ChriÅ¿tian world, and alÅ¿o a temporall Prince of Å¿ome Prouinces thereof.</q>

               <p n="15">15. But <hi>fourthly</hi> obÅ¿erue, <hi>good Reader,</hi> another palpable vntruth, which D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> in this place affirmeth. <hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> as you haue Å¿eene, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by his third argument to proue, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power as it is temporall, is among ChriÅ¿tians Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall power, as it is Å¿pirituall; and his argument was this: <hi>If the temporall gouernment hinder the Å¿pirituall good, the Prince is bound to change that manner of gouernment, euen with the hinderance of the temporall good, therefore it is a Å¿igne that the temporall power is Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall..</hi> The antecedent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition I did grant, and I denied his conÅ¿equence. Now <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that for this cauÅ¿e I denyed his conÅ¿equence, for that of the temporall and Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power is not made formally one politike body,</hi> which is very vntrue. For although I Å¿hould acknowledge, as in very deede I doe, that the temporall and Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power, as they are referred to ChriÅ¿t the inviÅ¿ible and celeÅ¿tiall head, doe make <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> one totall body, or common-wealth, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of both powers, which may be called the ChriÅ¿tian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, but more properly the ChriÅ¿tian world, yet I would and doe denie his conÅ¿equence: and the reaÅ¿on hereof I alledged before, for that they are not <hi>eÅ¿Å¿entiall parts</hi> of this totall bodie, as the bodie &amp; Å¿oule are of man, but <hi>integrall</hi> parts, as two Å¿houlders, two Å¿ides, hands, feete, eyes, eares, &amp;c. are <hi>integrall</hi> parts of mans bodie, and doe not make an <hi>eÅ¿Å¿entiall,</hi> but an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrall</hi> compound, in which kinde of compound it is not neceÅ¿Å¿arie, as I Å¿hewed before<note n="k" place="margin">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20729:117"/>
as I doe, that <hi>temporall and Å¿pirituall power</hi> doe make <hi>formally</hi> one politike bodie, or temporall common wealth, taking <hi>temporall and Å¿pirituall power</hi> in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Å¿enÅ¿e, as is declared by <hi>D.

               <p n="16">16 And truly if this argument of Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> were of force, it would in my opinion convince, that not only the temporall power among ChriÅ¿tians is Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but alÅ¿o that the temporall power among infidell Princes is alÅ¿o Å¿ubiect to the <hi>Popes</hi> Å¿pirituall authoritie, which neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth denie; for if the temporall gouernment of an infidell Prince doe hurt and hinder the Å¿pirituall good of ChriÅ¿tian Religion, he is bound to change that manner of gouernment euen with the hinderance of temporall good, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I might conclude with Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that it is a Å¿igne that the temporall power of an heathen Prince is Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall power of ChriÅ¿tian religion. And therefore as the changing of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gouernment among infidells, when it hindereth the Å¿pirituall good of ChriÅ¿tian religion, is no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Å¿igne of any Å¿ubiection <hi>per Å¿e</hi> of their temporall power to the <hi>Popes</hi> Å¿pirituall authoritie, but onely of a bond of charitie, whereby all men are by the law of God and nature bound not to hinder true Å¿pirituall good for a temporall commoditie, Å¿o alÅ¿o among ChriÅ¿tians it is no probable Å¿igne of any Å¿ubiection or Å¿ubordination of the temporall power to the Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, but at the moÅ¿t of a greater bond of charitie, whereby ChriÅ¿tians not only by the law of God and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20729:117"/>
nature, but alÅ¿o by the bond of ChriÅ¿tian religion, which they profeÅ¿Å¿e, are obliged not to hinder the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good thereof for a temporall commoditie.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Now you Å¿hall Å¿ee, how inÅ¿ufficiently alÅ¿o <hi>D.

And <hi>firÅ¿t</hi> to my <hi>first</hi> anÅ¿wer <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> replyeth thus:<note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 341.</note> that by my anÅ¿wer <hi>it is clearely gathered, that I Å¿ay nothing in this place, which maketh to the ouerthrowing of</hi> Card. Bellarmines <hi>argument. For I confeÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>that a Prince of a leÅ¿Å¿e noble common-wealth is not bound to Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any detriment onely for the order of charitie, that an other common-wealth more noble doe not Å¿uffer the like, vnleÅ¿Å¿e either hee bee Å¿ubiect to the Prince of that noble common-wealth, or vnleÅ¿Å¿e one hath both the common wealths Å¿ubiect to him. Therefore I am conÅ¿trained,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>to confeÅ¿Å¿e, that the principall reaÅ¿on, why a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Prince ought to Å¿uffer detriment in temporalls, lest that the Å¿pirituall good be hindered, is not the order of charitie, but the Å¿ubiection of the temporall common wealth to the Å¿pirituall, when they concurre to make one ChriÅ¿tian common-wealth, or one myÅ¿ticall bodie of ChriÅ¿t. Therefore I haue not,</hi> Å¿aith hee, <hi>confuted</hi> Card: Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines <hi>argument, but haue yeelded vp the bucklers, yea and alÅ¿o haue confirmed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 But truly it is Å¿trange to Å¿ee, with what bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, men otherwiÅ¿e learned, dare aduenture to auouch Å¿uch groÅ¿Å¿e and palpable vntruths, and when their anÅ¿wers are cleane ouerthrowne, to brag not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the victorie, but alÅ¿o that their <hi>AduerÅ¿arie</hi> hath granted, and confirmed their anÅ¿wers. For obÅ¿erue, <hi>good Reader,</hi> how vntrue and fraudulent this anÅ¿wer is. I affirmed, as you haue Å¿eene, that the reaÅ¿on, why a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20729:118"/>
temporall ChriÅ¿tian Prince is bound to change his manner of gouernment, if it hinder the Å¿pirituall good, is not, for that the temporall power is <hi>per Å¿e,</hi> and of it owne nature Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall, as Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pretended, but becauÅ¿e he being a ChriÅ¿tian Prince, to whom eÅ¿pecially, more then to a Heathen, it doth belong to haue care of true Å¿pirituall good, which ChriÅ¿tian Religion ought chiefly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is by the order of charitie, and not for any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinÅ¿ecall Å¿ubiection, or Å¿ubordination of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power to the Å¿pirituall, bound to preferre, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the Å¿pirituall good before the temporall. And whereas <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> replyed, <hi>that for the order of charitie one common wealth, although the leÅ¿Å¿e noble, is not bound to Å¿uffer detriment, that an other common wealth more noble do not Å¿uffer the like detriment; and one priuate man, who is bound to giue all his goods for the preÅ¿eruation of his owne common wealth, is not likewiÅ¿e bound to doe the like for an other common wealth although more noble; Seeing therefore that a temporall common-wealth is bound to Å¿uffer damage for the Å¿pirituall, it is a Å¿igne, that they are not two diuerÅ¿e common-wealths, but parts of one and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame common wealth, and one Å¿ubiect to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. To this <hi>Reply</hi> I anÅ¿wered, by Å¿hewing the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritie betwixt one temporall common-wealth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an other, and a temporall common-wealth compared to the Å¿pirituall common wealth: becauÅ¿e the Å¿ame Prince, or Å¿ubiect of one temporall common wealth is Å¿eldome, or neuer, a Prince or Å¿ubiect of the other, and therefore the order of charitie requireth, that both the Prince and Å¿ubiect ought to prefer the temporall good of their owne common wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the temporall good of an other more noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth: As alÅ¿o a man leÅ¿Å¿e noble ought in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to prefer, if other things be alike, his own tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good before the temporall good of an other man more noble. But if it Å¿hould Å¿o fall out, that the Å¿ame
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20729:118"/>
man were Prince of both common wealths, or the Å¿ame priuate man were a part and member of both common wealths, in this caÅ¿e the order of charitie would require, that he, who is member, or hath charge of both common-wealths, Å¿hould preferre, if other things be alike, the temporall good of the more noble common wealth before the temporal good of the leÅ¿Å¿e noble, not by reaÅ¿on of any Å¿ubiection of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth to the other, but becauÅ¿e both common-wealths are Å¿ubiect to the Å¿ame Prince, or the Å¿ame priuate man is Å¿ubiect to both common wealths, and therefore they ought with due reÅ¿pect and order of charitie to haue care of both, and to preferre the more worthy common wealth before the leÅ¿Å¿e worthy.</p>
               <p n="20">20. As likewiÅ¿e if one man hath diuerÅ¿e trades, one more noble, an other leÅ¿Å¿e noble, one more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and other leÅ¿Å¿e profitable, if in caÅ¿e he Å¿hould bee compelled to looÅ¿e, or preiudice one of his trades, the order of charitie would require, that hee Å¿hould rather looÅ¿e, or preiudice the leÅ¿Å¿e noble, then the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the leÅ¿Å¿e profitable, then the more profitable trade, neither from hence could it bee gathered, that one trade were Å¿ubiect, or Å¿ubordained to another, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that both trades were Å¿ubiect to one man. So likwiÅ¿e if a man were conÅ¿trained to looÅ¿e either his eye or his finger, the order of charitie would require that hee Å¿hould preferre the eye before the finger, for that the eye is a more noble, a more neceÅ¿Å¿arie, a more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table part of the body then the finger, and yet from hence we cannot well conclude, that therefore the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is Å¿ubiect or Å¿ubordained to the eye, but that both are parts and members of the body of the Å¿ame man, who therefore by order of charitie ought with due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and reÅ¿pect to haue a care of the whole body and euery part thereof, and to preferre the more worthy, neceÅ¿Å¿ary or profitable before the leÅ¿Å¿e worthy, neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arie or profitable member. And this I Å¿aid was the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20729:119"/>
plaine caÅ¿e of the temporall power among ChriÅ¿tians compared to the Å¿pirituall, for that the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall and ciuill power, temporall power and Å¿pirituall Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection &amp;c. are among ChriÅ¿tians Å¿o vnited in one Å¿ubiect, that the Å¿ame ChriÅ¿tian man is a part, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Citizen both of the temporall, and alÅ¿o of the Å¿pirituall common wealth, and both common wealths may be Å¿ubiect to the Å¿ame Prince, as appeareth in the Pope, and therefore the order of charitie doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that euery ChriÅ¿tian man ought to preferre the Å¿pirituall good, and Å¿pirituall common wealth, before the temporall good and the temporall common-wealth, not for that the temporall power, or common wealth is Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall, but for that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian Princes and people are parts, members, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of both common wealths, and the Å¿pirituall is farre more noble, and worthy, and therefore if other things be alike, to bee preferred before the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, by them who are parts and members of them both.</p>
               <p n="21">21.

That which</hi> Card.

In which Church of ChriÅ¿t, and alÅ¿o ChriÅ¿tian world, all things are Å¿o well ordered and diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, that temporall things ought by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of good ChriÅ¿tians, to Å¿erue Å¿pirituall things, and temporall Princes, although in Å¿piritualls they are Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall power of the Church, yet in temporalls, or as they haue temporall power, they are not Å¿ubiect but Å¿upreame, and conÅ¿equently the temporall power it Å¿elfe Å¿peaking <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> is not Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall, nor dooth compound the Å¿pirituall kingdome or Church of ChriÅ¿t.

For the Å¿pirit and fleÅ¿h are as it were two common-wealths, which may be found Å¿eparated, and alÅ¿o vnited. The fleÅ¿h hath Å¿enÅ¿e and appetite, to which are anÅ¿werable their acts and proper obiects, and of all which the immediate end is the health &amp; good conÅ¿titution of the body. The Å¿pirit hath vnderÅ¿tanding and wil, and acts and proportionate obiects, and for her end the health and perfection of the Å¿oule. The fleÅ¿h is found without the Å¿pirit in beaÅ¿ts, the Å¿pirit is found without the fleÅ¿h in Angels.</hi>

For the fleÅ¿h is Å¿ubiect, the Å¿pirit is Å¿uperiour, and although the Å¿pirit doth not intermeddle hir Å¿elfe with the actions of the fleÅ¿h, but doth Å¿uffer the fleÅ¿h to exerciÅ¿e all hir actions, as Å¿hee doth exerciÅ¿e in beaÅ¿ts, yet when they doe hurt the end of the Å¿pirit, the Å¿pirit doth command the fleÅ¿h, and doth puniÅ¿h hir, and if it be needfull, doth appoint faÅ¿tings, and alÅ¿o other afflictions, euen with Å¿ome detriment, and weakning of the bodie, and doth compell the tongue not to Å¿peake, the eyes not to Å¿ee, &amp;c. In like manner if any action of the fleÅ¿h, yea and death it Å¿elfe, be neceÅ¿Å¿arie to obtaine the end of the Å¿pirit, the Å¿pirit hath power to command the fleÅ¿h to expoÅ¿e hir Å¿elfe and all hirs, as wee Å¿ee in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi>

that the body could reÅ¿iÅ¿t the command of the Å¿oule, yet the Å¿oule of her Å¿elfe hath not power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e any corporall action without the concurrance of a corporall organ; which manner of Å¿ubiection is not betweene the temporall and Å¿pirituall power, for that this Å¿ubiection being in diuerÅ¿e perÅ¿ons hauing free will, is free and voluntarie, and therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand may be reÅ¿iÅ¿ted, but the former being of the body to the Å¿oule, making one only perÅ¿on, who hath free will, is neceÅ¿Å¿arie and naturall, and therefore can not be reÅ¿iÅ¿ted.</p>

               <p n="12">12. The <hi>Å¿econd</hi> is, that the Å¿pirituall power may command or forbid the ciuill power to exerciÅ¿e ciuill actions, not onely when they are neceÅ¿Å¿arie, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the end of the Å¿pirituall power, which is the health of the Å¿oule, but alÅ¿o when they are neceÅ¿Å¿arie or hurtfull to the end of the temporall power, which is temporall peace, as the Å¿oule hath power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or forbid the bodie to exerciÅ¿e bodily actions, as to Å¿ee, heare, Å¿peake &amp;c. not onely when they are neceÅ¿Å¿ary, or hurtfull to the end, and good of the Å¿oule, which is Å¿pirituall life and health, but alÅ¿o when they are neceÅ¿Å¿arie or hurtfull to the good of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is bodily health and life. And therefore Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> declaring this Å¿imilitude of the Å¿pirit and fleÅ¿h doth only affirme, that the Å¿pirit doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the fleÅ¿h, when her actions are hurtfull to the end of the Å¿pirit, but cunningly omitteth, that the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alÅ¿o dorh command the fleÅ¿h, when her actions are neceÅ¿Å¿arie, or hurtfull to the end of the fleÅ¿h, leaÅ¿t the <hi>Reader</hi> Å¿hould preÅ¿ently perceiue therby the diÅ¿parity of this Å¿imilitude, or elÅ¿e from thence inferre, that in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:20729:127"/>
the Å¿ame manner the Å¿pirituall power may command the temporall power not onely in order to Å¿pirituall good, but alÅ¿o in order to temporall good, which is the CanoniÅ¿t, doctrine, and which <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> doth at large impugne.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>LaÅ¿tly,</hi> in what manner S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> did compare the temporall and Å¿pirituall power, or rather temporall and Å¿pirituall Princes to the bodie and Å¿oule, I haue Å¿ufficiently declared before<note n="h" place="margin">

So that neither from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>S.

For S. <hi>Bernard</hi> doth Å¿ay, <hi>that the materiall Å¿word is the</hi> Popes, <hi>and doth belong to the</hi> Pope, but with this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>in Å¿ome Å¿ort, to bee drawne foorth for the Church, but not by the Church, with the hand of the Souldier, not of the PrieÅ¿t, at the becke,</hi> or direction, <hi>of the PrieÅ¿t, but at the command of the Emperour:</hi> and I alÅ¿o Å¿ay the very Å¿ame. But <hi>S. Bernard</hi> doth not Å¿ay, that the materiall Å¿word is Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall Å¿word <hi>per Å¿e,</hi> but only <hi>in Å¿ome Å¿ort, to be drawne forth for the Church, not by the Church</hi> &amp;c. From which words it is plainely gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the materiall Å¿word, or temporall power is, according to S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall, not <hi>per Å¿e,</hi> but <hi>per accidons,</hi> in Å¿piritualls, not in temporalls, to be commanded in Å¿ome caÅ¿e by the PrieÅ¿t, as he is a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:20729:131"/>
PrieÅ¿t, but not to be drawne forth, or vÅ¿ed by a PrieÅ¿t as he is a PrieÅ¿t, but as he is a temporall Prince, or a publike, or priuate Å¿ouldier. In like manner I Å¿ay with Pope <hi>Boniface, that the Å¿word is vnder the Å¿word, and the temporall power is Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall,</hi> but Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> doth not Å¿ay, that the Å¿word is <hi>per Å¿e</hi> vnder the Å¿word, and the temporall power is <hi>per Å¿e</hi> Å¿ubiect to Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall authoritie, and therefore, Å¿eeing that hee doth imitate S. <hi>Bernards</hi> words, as Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here affirmeth, he is to be vnderÅ¿tood in that Å¿enÅ¿e, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> vnderÅ¿tood them, to wit, that the Å¿word is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Å¿word, in <hi>Å¿ome Å¿ort,</hi> and the temporall power Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall in <hi>Å¿ome Å¿ort, to be drawne foorth, or vÅ¿ed for the Church, but not by the Church</hi> &amp;c. as I now declared.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Thirdly, when</hi> Widdrington, <hi>affirmeth,</hi> Å¿aith <hi>D. Schulckenius, that the Church hath not by the law of God power to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word euen in order to Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, he Å¿peaketh too ambiguouÅ¿ly. For the law of God doth not command EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall men to vÅ¿e with their own hand the materiall Å¿word, neither doth it Å¿o forbid them, but that his lawfull for them in Å¿ome caÅ¿es to vÅ¿e it alÅ¿o with their owne hand: But neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e according to</hi> S.

               </p>
               <p n="15">15. But my words are very plaine, and no whit ambiguous I Å¿ay, that the <hi>Church,</hi> taking the <hi>Church,</hi> not <hi>materially,</hi> for all the members of the <hi>Church,</hi> but for Churchmen, <hi>formally</hi> as they are <hi>Churchmen,</hi> or which is all one, for the <hi>Church,</hi> as it conÅ¿iÅ¿teth of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall power, are according to S. <hi>Bernards</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine commanded not to draw forth, or vÅ¿e with their owne hands the materiall Å¿word euen in order to Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20729:132"/>
good.

But if the <hi>Pope</hi> becom a temporall Prince or a PrieÅ¿t do lawfully becom a Soldier, to fight either in his own defence, or in the defence of others, which ChriÅ¿t did not forbid, although the Church in Å¿ome caÅ¿es hath forbidden it, neither I, nor S. <hi>Bernard</hi> doe denie, that the Pope, as he is a temporall Prince, or a PrieÅ¿t, as he is a lawfull Souldier, hath power to vÅ¿e with their owne hands the materiall Å¿word. Neither did S. <hi>Bernard</hi> euer grant, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he is <hi>Pope,</hi> or a PrieÅ¿t as he is a PrieÅ¿t, or, which is all one, by his Å¿pirituall, or PrieÅ¿tly authority, hath power to draw foorth, or to vÅ¿e with his owne hands the materiall Å¿word, although the <hi>Pope</hi> by his Å¿pirituall power may direct and command a temporall Prince to draw it foorth, and vÅ¿e it, when the neceÅ¿Å¿itie of the Church Å¿hall require, which onely D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph doth affirme.</p>

The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to command wicked men to be Å¿laine is in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but the authoritie to beckon is in the Pope and PrieÅ¿ts. And this beckoning as hath beene Å¿ayd, is a preaching of the Law of God, and an exhorting, that Princes will obey the Law of God, Wherupon S.</hi> Bernard <hi>Å¿heweth how both the materiall and Å¿pirituall Å¿word are the Churches, and doe belong to the Church, not for as much as concerneth vÅ¿e or command, but for as much as concerneth beckoning: whereupon he Å¿peaketh in this manner to</hi> Eugenius, hee that denieth the materiall Å¿word to be thine, Å¿eemeth to me not to regard Å¿ufficiently the word of our Lord Å¿aying, <hi>Returne thy Å¿word into thy Å¿cabard,</hi> and Å¿o foorth as it followeth in <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p n="19">19. Wherefore, according to <hi>S.

vÅ¿e thereof, and alÅ¿o becauÅ¿e if the Souldier will not vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word at the Emperours command; the Emperour, as Emperour, may vÅ¿e it himÅ¿elfe, and with his owne hand, which the PrieÅ¿t, as PrieÅ¿t, or, which is all one, the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall power, according to <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> cannot doe; and moreouer becauÅ¿e the Emperour, as Emperour, may compell the Å¿ouldier with temporall puniÅ¿hments to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word, and not onely depriue him of his power and right to vÅ¿e the Å¿ame; but alÅ¿o of his temporall life, which the PrieÅ¿t, as PrieÅ¿t, or the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical power, cannot doe.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And therefore who would not maruaile to Å¿ee D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> Å¿o boldly, and in Å¿uch publike writings to affirme, <hi>That the queÅ¿tion is not, whether the Å¿pirituall Prince hath dominion, right, or power to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word: but onely, whether the Å¿word be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Å¿word, and whether the temporall power bee Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Å¿pirituall. And whereas</hi> Widdrington, Å¿aith he, <hi>in this place confeÅ¿Å¿eth, that the Church hath power to command, or forbid in time of neceÅ¿Å¿itie the vÅ¿e of the materiall Å¿word, from thence we doe gather that the Å¿word is vnder the Å¿word, and the temporall power is Å¿ubiect to the command, and prohibition of the Å¿pirituall power, which onely</hi> Card. Bellarmine <hi>in that his Å¿econd argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did intend. Wherefore</hi> Widdrington <hi>doth Å¿eeme to decline of Å¿et purpoÅ¿e the principall queÅ¿tion. For, as wee haue often Å¿aid, the queÅ¿tion is not concerning the dominion, or vÅ¿e of the materiall Å¿word, but concerning the power to direct it, and concerning the Å¿ubiection of the materiall Å¿word to the Å¿pirituall. But theÅ¿e in the option of S.</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>are moÅ¿t manifeÅ¿t. And for as much as appertaineth to the vÅ¿e of the materiall Å¿word, wee aÅ¿Å¿ent altogether to S.</hi> Bernard, <hi>that it doth not beÅ¿eeme EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall men to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word, but onely the Å¿pirituall, and thus much onely thoÅ¿e words of our Sauiour doe Å¿ignifie,</hi> Put vp thy Å¿word into thy Å¿cabbard, <hi>and thoÅ¿e of S.</hi> Bernard,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:20729:134"/>
Why doeÅ¿t thou againe attempt to vÅ¿e the Å¿word, which once thou waÅ¿t commanded to put into the Å¿cabbard? <hi>For heere it is not meant of the Law of God, by which EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall men are abÅ¿olutely forbidden to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word; Å¿eeing that it is manifeÅ¿t, that in Å¿ome caÅ¿es, and eÅ¿pecially in defence of themÅ¿elues, and of their Countrey: this is lawfull, but of the command of God, by which Cleargie men are inÅ¿tructed, and taught, that their vocation is not to fight with the materiall, but with the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Å¿word.</hi> Thus D. <hi>Schulckenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. But it is Å¿trange to Å¿ee, how farre affection will carry the pens of learned men; In very truth I Å¿hould neuer haue imagined, that D. <hi>Schulckenius,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned man, who hath read my <hi>Apologie,</hi> would euer haue beene Å¿o bold, as to affirme, <hi>That the queÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt me, and</hi> Card. Bellarmine <hi>is not, whether the Pope hath power to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word, but onely whether the Å¿word be vnder the Å¿word, and the temporall power Å¿ubiect to the command, and prohibition of the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pirituall power, and that this only was intended by Card.</hi> Bellarmine <hi>in his Å¿econd argument.</hi> For firÅ¿t concerning the queÅ¿tion betwixt mee, and Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> it is euident, that I haue oftentimes declared in my <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> and D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> alÅ¿o Å¿etteth downe my words, that the true Å¿tate of the queÅ¿tion betwixt mee and Card. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is not concerning the Popes power to <hi>command,</hi> but to <hi>diÅ¿poÅ¿e</hi> of temporalls, nor whether the Å¿word be in <hi>any manner</hi> whatÅ¿oeuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Å¿word, or the temporal power <hi>in any Å¿ort</hi> Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall, but <hi>in what manner</hi> the Å¿word is vnder the Å¿word, and <hi>after what Å¿ort</hi> the temporall power is Å¿ubiect to the Å¿pirituall. For I haue often granted, that the Å¿pirituall power, or the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> may <hi>command</hi> temporalls, and the vÅ¿e of the materiall Å¿word, and puniÅ¿h diÅ¿obedient Princes with EccleÅ¿ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cenÅ¿ures: but what, which I vtterly denied, was, that the Å¿pirituall power, or the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Pope</hi> may <hi>diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:20729:134"/>
of temporalls, <hi>vÅ¿e</hi> the materiall Å¿word, or <hi>puniÅ¿h</hi> diÅ¿obedient Princes by taking away their liues, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, or goods.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is alÅ¿o manifeÅ¿t, that Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in his Å¿econd argument did not onely intend to proue, that the temporal power is Å¿ubiect to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and prohibition of the Å¿pirituall power, as D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> affirmeth, but alÅ¿o, that the Å¿pirituall power may <hi>vÅ¿e,</hi> and diÅ¿poÅ¿e of temporalls, depoÅ¿e temporal Princes, and inÅ¿titute others, and conÅ¿traine or puniÅ¿h with temporall puniÅ¿hments. For marke, I pray you, his Å¿econd argument: In the firÅ¿t part thereof he argueth thus. <hi>The power to vÅ¿e and diÅ¿poÅ¿e of temporalls</hi> (and conÅ¿equently of the materiall Å¿word which is a temporall thing) <hi>is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the Å¿pirituall end, becauÅ¿e otherwiÅ¿e wicked Princes might without puniÅ¿hment fauour Heretickes, and overthrow Religion, therefore the Church hath alÅ¿o, this power.</hi> And yet D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> doth not bluÅ¿h to affirme, that Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Å¿econd argument did onely intend to proue, that the temporall power is Å¿ubiect to the command, and prohibition of the Å¿pirituall power. And in the <hi>Å¿econd</hi> part of his argument hee concludeth thus: <hi>Therefore much more the Å¿pirituall common-wealth, hath power to command the temporall common-wealth, which is Å¿ubiect vnto her, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿traine her to change her gouernment, and to depoÅ¿e Princes, and to inÅ¿titute others, when Å¿he can not otherwiÅ¿e defend her Å¿pirituall good. And in this manner are to bee vnderÅ¿tood the words of</hi> S. Bernard, <hi>and</hi> Pope Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus Card. <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> So that according to Card. <hi>Bellarmine, S. Bernards</hi> words doe proue, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power not onely to <hi>command</hi> the materiall Å¿word, but alÅ¿o to vÅ¿e it, vnleÅ¿Å¿e the <hi>materiall</hi> Å¿word is not to be comprehended vnder the name of <hi>temporalls.</hi> And therefore not I, but D. <hi>Schulckenius</hi> doth of Å¿et purpoÅ¿e decline the difficultie, and alÅ¿o
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20729:135"/>
vntruly affirmeth, that Card: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to proue in his Å¿econd argument, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word, but onely that the materiall Å¿word is Å¿ubiect to the command and prohibition of the Å¿pirituall power, Å¿eeing that Card: <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Å¿econd argument doth moÅ¿t clearely Å¿hew the contrarie.</p>
               <p n="23">23 But marke now how clearely <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> doth either contradict <hi>S.

Now <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> affirmeth<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 390.</note>, <hi>that for as much at appertaineth to the vÅ¿e of the materiall Å¿word, he aÅ¿Å¿enteth altogether to S. Bernard, that it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eeme EccleÅ¿iasticall men to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word, but onely the Å¿pirituall; and thus much onely thoÅ¿e words of our Sauiour doe Å¿ignifie,</hi> Returne thy Å¿word into the Å¿cabbard; <hi>and thoÅ¿e of S. Bernard,</hi> why doÅ¿t thou againe attempt to vÅ¿e the Å¿word, which once thou waÅ¿t commanded to put into the Å¿cabard? <hi>For here it is not meant of the law of God, by which EccleÅ¿iasticall men are abÅ¿olutely forbidden to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word, Å¿eeing that it is manifeÅ¿t, that in Å¿ome caÅ¿es, and eÅ¿pecially in defence of themÅ¿elues and of their countrey, this is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but of the command of God, by which Cleargie men are inÅ¿tructed, and taught, that their vocation is not to fight with the materiall, but with the Å¿pirituall Å¿word.</hi> Thus <hi>D. Schulckenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 But if <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> meane that EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call men are onely for decencie, which implyeth no command, not to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word, he plainly
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:20729:135"/>
contradicteth <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> to whom neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e hee affirmeth altogether to aÅ¿Å¿ent, who expreÅ¿Å¿ely auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>S. Peter</hi> was not only <hi>counÅ¿ailed,</hi> but <hi>commanded</hi> not to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word. And therefore <hi>S. Bernards</hi> words can not otherwiÅ¿e be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood, but that EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall men, as they are EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall men, and the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Pope,</hi> are by the <hi>command</hi> of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> abÅ¿olutely forbidden to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word; for <hi>S. Bernard</hi> did not intend to affirme, that EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall men, if they become temporall Princes, or being conÅ¿idered, as they are priuate men, or citizens, and parts, or members of the temporall common-wealth, are by the <hi>command</hi> of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> forbidden to vÅ¿e the materiall Å¿word, and to fight in defence of their owne perÅ¿ons, or of their Countrey.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Wherefore thoÅ¿e laÅ¿t words of <hi>D. Schulckenius,</hi> to wit, <hi>that S. Bernards Å¿aying is to be vnderÅ¿tood of the command of God, by which Cleargie men are inÅ¿tructed, and taught, that their vocation is not to fight with the materiall, but with the Å¿pirituall Å¿word, are Å¿omewhat equivocall.</hi> For if <hi>D. Schulckenius</hi> doe onely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand of Å¿uch an inÅ¿truction, which implyeth no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ChriÅ¿t, but onely a certaine decencie, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell, and aduiÅ¿e, for that it doth not beÅ¿eeme the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of thoÅ¿e men, who haue a Å¿pirituall vocation, to fight with the materiall Å¿word, hee plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth himÅ¿elfe, and alÅ¿o <hi>S. Bernard</hi> himÅ¿elfe, for that hee acknowledgeth <hi>a command of God, whereby Cleargie men are inÅ¿tructed</hi> &amp;c. but this inÅ¿truction Å¿uppoÅ¿eth no command of God; <hi>S.

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:20729:136"/>
Å¿word; for that although the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall power doth according to <hi>S.

And if <hi>D.

thereof, which implieth a power to vÅ¿e the Å¿ame, but onely, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> being a Å¿pirituall Prince or PÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, may puniÅ¿h the Emperor for his contempt with Å¿pirituall puniÅ¿hments, which only doe belong to the <hi>coercive</hi> power of the Å¿upreme Å¿pirituall Prince &amp; PaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Å¿pirituall kingdome &amp; Church of <hi>ChriÅ¿t.</hi>

that hee vÅ¿eth his power contrary to the lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Å¿pirituall PaÅ¿tour, but hee doth not Å¿inne againÅ¿t the Å¿peciall vertue of legall, or morall iuÅ¿tice, in vÅ¿ing his authority ouer them, who are not his Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and ouer whom hee hath no temporall power and Authority, in that manner as another man, who is not their Prince, Å¿hould offend.

               <p n="38">38 As for example, it is a Å¿inne againÅ¿t the vertue of liberality for one to giue away his goods prodigally, although if wee reÅ¿pect iuÅ¿tice hee hath true and full power to giue them away, for that he giueth nothing but that, which is his owne: and therefore that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall guift, although it be vnlawfull, yet is not vniuÅ¿t, as iuÅ¿tice is taken, not as it comprehendeth all vertues in generall, but in particular for a Å¿peciall vertue, and one of the foure Cardinall vertues. So alÅ¿o it is a Å¿in againÅ¿t the vertue of temperance to giue money to commit an vnhoneÅ¿t act, and yet the gift is not vniuÅ¿t for that hee giueth nothing but his owne, and which according to iuÅ¿tice hee hath power to giue.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3 In the very firÅ¿t beginning I affirmed, and Mr. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> in his firÅ¿t Chapter related my words, <hi>that the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition, which hee made, to wit, that the Popes power to excommunicate Princes is denyed in this Oath, is moÅ¿t falÅ¿e</hi> and then he took no exception againÅ¿t this word, <hi>moÅ¿t falÅ¿e:</hi> and now after he hath Å¿o often fallen very foule vpon mee, with charging mee with being <hi>abÅ¿urd, ridiculous, fooliÅ¿h, malicious, impudent, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,</hi> with <hi>cogging, Å¿coffing gibing, heretike, and being no good Child of the Catholike Church,</hi> and vÅ¿ing many Å¿uch like Å¿landerous, and diÅ¿gracefull termes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t mee, hee taketh it very ill for that I onely affirme his aÅ¿Å¿ertion to bee <hi>falÅ¿e,</hi> which word neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e is vÅ¿uall in Schooles among DiÅ¿puters and AnÅ¿werers, and is not taken for any diÅ¿gracefull tearme, being in Å¿enÅ¿e all one with <hi>vntrue,</hi> or <hi>I deny the aÅ¿Å¿ertion or poÅ¿ition.</hi> But becauÅ¿e I perceiue Mr. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> patience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

            <p n="4">4 But to the matter.

               </gap>hat it is true if hee had affirmed it.

And my reaÅ¿on is, for that the doctrine for the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depoÅ¿e Princes, I will not Å¿ay at this preÅ¿ent, is a <hi>falÅ¿e</hi> doctrine, and <hi>repugnant</hi> to the holy Scriptures, and to the ancient Fathers, but it is not <hi>certaine,</hi> and a point of faith, (as MaiÅ¿ter <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> and Å¿ome others of his companie will needs haue it to be) and the <hi>contrary</hi> is <hi>probable</hi> and conÅ¿equently may with a <hi>Å¿afe</hi> and <hi>probable</hi> conÅ¿cience be acknowledged and maintained by any Catholike. But whether it be <hi>probable,</hi> that the Pope hath power to depoÅ¿e Princes or no, I doe not at this preÅ¿ent diÅ¿pute, neither doe I either grant it, or deny it, or meddle at all therewith, as being vnneceÅ¿Å¿ary to proue the <hi>oath</hi> to be lawfull. That which I affirme at this time is, that it is <hi>probable,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no Å¿uch power. Let vs firÅ¿t agree
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20729:206"/>
about this point, that it is <hi>probable,</hi> that the Pope hath no Å¿uch power, and then we will diÅ¿pute, how <hi>probable</hi> it is, that he hath Å¿uch a power. In the meane time all Mr. <hi>Fitzherberts</hi> cunning, turning, and winding Å¿hall not draw mee to Å¿o great a diÅ¿aduantage, as to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee to proue that to be <hi>certaine,</hi> which he, and the reÅ¿t of my <hi>AduerÅ¿aries</hi> will not grant to be Å¿o much as <hi>probable.</hi>
